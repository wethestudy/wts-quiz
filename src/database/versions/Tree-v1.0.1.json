The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\nIn this example, we are to find the maximum deflection between the roller \\\\(B\\\\) and hinge [support](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) \\\\(D\\\\) using the area-moment method.\n## Main Solution\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Locate the Position of Maximum Deflection\n![Locating the position of maximum deflection](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a173a27d2174b3a3c33e_WTS-Structure_29.5-1.png)\nTo start, we would need to locate where between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) is \\\\(\\Delta\\_{max}\\\\) positioned.\nSince there are two loading conditions between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\), we don't know if \\\\(\\Delta\\_{max}\\\\) is between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\). What we will do here is to assume first where it might be, then compute for \\\\(x\\\\). Afterward, we assess whether our assumption is correct. \nUsing the figure above, let's first assume that the maximum translation occurs between points \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\). For ease, we'll consider the [moment-by-parts diagram](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-area-moment-method-using-moment-by-parts).\nRecall that \\\\(\\Delta\\_{max}\\\\) will occur at the point of zero rotation (when \\\\(\\theta = 0\\\\), \\\\(\\Delta = \\Delta\\_{max}\\\\)). With any computed rotation, say \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\), we use the [first theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-change-in-slope-in-the-area-moment-method) of the area moment method to verify our assumption.\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{\\Delta\\_{\\max }}-\\theta\\_B=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2} \\frac{M}{E I} d x\\\\)\n\\\\(0-\\left(-\\frac{823.92}{E I}\\right)=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[27(x-2)+\\frac{1}{2}(405)(x-2)\\right.\\left.-\\frac{1}{4}(151.875)(x-2)\\right]\\\\)\n\\\\(x=6.3\\\\)\nWith \\\\(x\\\\) solved, we evaluate if this assumption is correct. Since it is within the limits of segment \\\\(BC \\left(2 \\leq x \\lt 6.5\\right)\\\\), we can say that the maximum deflection occurs at \\\\(x = 6.3\\\\). If it is outside of the limits, then our guess is wrong, and we would need to solve for \\\\(x\\\\) again with the new assumption that it is between other segments.\n### Solve for Maximum Deflection\n![Finding the maximum deflection of beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a1866e54a97f6c314ee0_WTS-Structure_29.5-2.png)\nNow that we know where \\\\(\\Delta\\_{max}\\\\) is, we now solve for it. Solving for maximum translation is the same as solving any vertical translation. From the figure, we can derive relationships for \\\\(\\Delta\\_{max}\\\\):\nEquation 1-1: \\\\(\\frac{F F^{\\prime \\prime}}{4.3}=\\frac{D D^{\\prime \\prime}}{9}\\\\)\nEquation 1-2: \\\\(F F^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(-\\Delta\\_{\\max }\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{F / B}\\right)\\\\)\nEquation 1-3: \\\\(D D^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(+t\\_{D / B}\\right)\\\\)\nAfterward, we solve for \\\\(t\\_{F/B}\\\\). We'll use the [second theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-tangential-deviation) to solve for the deviation of \\\\(F\\\\) with reference tangent at \\\\(B\\\\):\n\\\\(t\\_{F / B}=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[(4.3 \\times 27)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.3\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.3 \\times 387\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4.3\\right)\\right.\\left.-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.3 \\times 132.512\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\times 4.3\\right)\\right]\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{F / B}=\\frac{1319}{E I}\\\\)\nSince \\\\(t\\_{F/B}\\\\) is positive, it confirms our sketch that \\\\(F^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) must be above the reference tangent drawn at \\\\(B\\\\).\nThe only thing left to do is to apply Equations 1-1 to 1-3 to solve for the maximum deflection:\n\\\\(\\frac{\\left(-\\Delta\\_{\\max }\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{F / B}\\right)}{4.3}=\\frac{\\left(+t\\_{D / B}\\right)}{9}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{\\max }=-\\left(\\frac{4.3}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}-\\frac{1319}{E I}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{\\max }=-\\frac{2223.86}{E I}\\\\)\n",

Depending on its applied orientation, it may act upward or downward or to the left or right.\n## Distributed Load\n![Different types of distributed load](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5b0e40f4d8e3b4d8daed_WTS-Structure_15-3.png)\nDistributed loads act over a specified length. It may represent live loads, water pressure, or earth pressure.\nDistributed loads \\\\(w\\\\) are force per unit length. It may act upward or downward or to the left or right, like concentrated loads.\nTypically, we express distributed loads as [polynomial functions](/tree-posts/what-are-polynomial-functions). Depending on the degree, there are other variations of distributed loads:\n### Uniform Loads\nThe distributed load is uniform if we have a polynomial function of 0th degree (meaning it's a horizontal line); so if we have a \\\\(5kN/m\\\\) uniform distributed load, it means that for every \\\\(1m\\\\), we have a force of \\\\(5kN\\\\). We equally distribute the said force throughout its length.\n### Uniform Varying\nUniform varying means the function of the distributed load is in the first degree (a line). The force either linearly gets larger or smaller depending on the orientation. For example, if we represent [water pressure](/tree-posts/what-is-fluid-pressure) as a uniform varying load, the load at the surface is zero, but as we go deeper, it becomes larger and larger.\nSince the function is linear, the change in load among points can be solved using ratio and proportion or slopes.\n### Non-Uniform\nAny distributed load higher than the first degree is non-uniform. Examples of non-uniform loads may range from dynamic loads such as wind or earthquakes.\nTypically, when representing these loads, we must know their mathematical [function](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions).\n## Planar Loads\n![Examples of planar loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5b156f382ac67aea6609_WTS-Structure_15-4.png)\nPlanar loads act over an area. It may represent all sorts of loads (dead loads, live loads, water/earth pressure, and the like).\nWe represent these as force per unit area, similar to stress/pressure; Like concentrated and distributed loads, it may act upward or downward or to the left or right.\nSimilar to distributed loads, we can represent these loads using plane curves. A uniform planar load would mean a flat horizontal plane acting on an area - the pressure is equal at any point along the affected area.\n## Summary\n> A moment or torsional load is a force that causes something to rotate. \n> Moment (or torsional) load is a product of force \\\\(F\\\\) and its lever arm \\\\(d\\\\).

Students familiar with any Physics class should be familiar with this concept. It deals with the balanced link between the structure's loads and its supports.\n### Compatibility Conditions\nThe next concept is [compatibility](/tree-posts/what-are-compatibility-conditions). When a structure stands, there is a default place. Eventually, when loads act on it, it deflects from said place. From this, there is a relationship between the imposed loads and the structure's movement. We study this connection through this idea.\n### Constitutive Equations\nFinally, we have the [last](/tree-posts/what-are-constitutive-equations). Whenever a load acts on an object, it will change shape - for example, it may elongate or compress. This idea is also the same for structures. We can study such links through this principle.\n## Summary\n> The majority of analysis methods in structural engineering revolve around the following concepts: (1) equilibrium principle, (2) compatibility conditions, and (3) constitutive equations.\n> Equilibrium deals with the balanced link between the structure's loads and its components.\n> Compatibility condition deal with the relationship between the structure's loads and its movement.\n> Constitutive equations concern with the connection between structural loads and its deformations.\n",

In this perspective, we create what we call the table of values. It's a table format of inputs and outputs. To construct one:\n-   First, give multiple inputs for the function and place it in one column. In our example, it would be a list of radius (1, 2, 3, etc.) \n-   Next, solve for its corresponding output in an adjacent column (\\\\(\\pi\\\\), \\\\(4\\pi\\\\), \\\\(9\\pi\\\\), etc.) \n-   The resulting table is the table of values.\n",

In our example, it would be the radius.\n-   Let the y-axis be the output, which is the area of the circle.\n-   We plot each input-output pair and draw a line through the points.\n## Why These Approaches?\nConsidering functions from different perspectives helps us understand the relationship between sets. For example,\n-   We use the analytical perspective to understand the relationship between groups logically.\n-   We use the numerical and graphical view to find certain relationships or patterns among values. If we have a set of values, we can see if it will follow a linear, parabolic, or cyclic pattern.\n-   We use the graphical approach to see a visual image of our function.\n## Summary\n> We can view and analyze mathematical functions in three ways: analytical, numerical, and graphical.\n> The analytical viewpoint is approaching the situation using its mathematical symbols and operations.\n> The numerical viewpoint makes use of the table of values.\n> The graphical viewpoint uses a plot between the inputs and outputs.\n",

      "Free Content": "Truss analysis is studying the truss's behavior imposed with loads. It serves as an initial step before designing it - finding the suitable material, size, and shape of the members and connections.\n## **What is A Full Analysis?**\nWhen studying a truss, [we need to perform the following analysis](/tree-posts/introduction-to-structural-analysis):\n1.  Assessing its [stability](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-truss-stability)\n2.  Finding the reactions\n3.  Solving for [internal force and stresses](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-internal-force-and-stresses)\n4.  And analyzing the [deflections](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection)\nThe internal forces of a truss would entail solving for axial forces. Part of this includes correctly identifying if it is tension or compression.\n## **Analysis Assumptions**\n### **Basic Truss Analysis**\n![Truss analysis assumptions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cb68545aff39f6eb41d0_WTS-Structure_20-1.png)\nIn elementary truss analysis, there are several assumptions to take note of: \n1.  The [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads) only act at the [joint](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections) connections,\n2.  We neglect the weight of the members, and \n3.  The joints are assumed to be frictionless [pin](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections) connections which means these are allowed to rotate (do not carry moment).\n### Why Assume?\nThese assumptions make the truss members a two-force member - a body with forces equal in magnitude but opposite in direction and collinear at its ends. As a result, it makes truss analysis simple, which we will see soon.\nHowever, it is most likely that these assumptions are dissimilar from real-life:\n1.  Forces may act on the member itself.\n2.  Members do have weight.\n3.  Joints may be rigid or semi-rigid connections.\nIdeally, if we want to copy the behavior of an actual truss, it is logical to consider these conditions. So, why assume these things? Won't our results be wrong since it's not an exact model of the problem?\nRemember that analysis aims to obtain reliable results. In most truss analysis situations, the results of a simplified study with these assumptions and an examination with actual behavior are nearly identical. The difference is that the latter is more complex and time-consuming, which is unnecessary. To support these assumptions, here are several reasons why these are valid:\n-   Most real-life loads do transfer the load at the truss's joints. For truss bridge construction, girders supporting the truss act on its joints.\n-   The self-weight of members transfers to the joints; because these weights are small compared to the imposed load, we can neglect it.\n-   Multiple studies show that joint connections for trusses have small or zero moments (provided that the bar forces meet at a common point); hence we can neglect it and assume the joint is a hinge.\n## **Summary**\n> Truss analysis is studying the truss's behavior imposed with loads.\n> There are four critical aspects for complete analysis: (1) stability, (2) reaction analysis, (3) internal force and stress analysis, and (4) deflection analysis.\n> Elementary truss analysis has essential assumptions: (1) the loads only act at the joints, (2) the weight of the members is neglected, and (3) the joints are assumed to be pin connections which means these are allowed to rotate.\n",

The former can be analyzed using [static equilibrium equations](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) ONLY, while the latter requires more than those equations.\nHow do we know if a structure is such? We first introduce two concepts: the Number of Unknowns \\\\(N\\_u\\\\) and the Number of Known Conditions \\\\(N\\_k\\\\) of a structure.\n### Number of Unknowns\nThe number of unknowns \\\\(N\\_u\\\\) refers to the number of reactions and internal forces we need to solve. It is the sum of (1) [external reaction components](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) \\\\(r\\\\) and (2) internal force components.\nBelow is a table of unknowns depending on the [type of structure](/tree-posts/investigating-the-fundamental-structures). The variable \\\\(m\\\\) refers to the number of members in the model.\n### Number of Known Conditions\nThe number of known conditions \\\\(N\\_k\\\\) refers to the number of equations we can use to solve the structure. It is the sum of (1) equilibrium equations and (2) conditional equations due to internal connections \\\\(e\\_c\\\\).\nBelow is a table of these conditions depending on the type of structure. The variable \\\\(j\\\\) refers to the number of joints in the model.\n## How to Classify Determinacy?\nTo classify if a structure is determinate or not, we need to compare the number of unknowns \\\\(N\\_u\\\\) and the number of known conditions \\\\(N\\_v\\\\):\n-   If \\\\(N\\_u = N\\_k\\\\), the number of unknowns is the same as the number of known equations. The equilibrium principle is sufficient to solve the structure; hence, it is determinate.\n-   If \\\\(N\\_u > N\\_k\\\\), there are more unknowns than known equations. We will need more equations to solve the structure; hence, it is indeterminate.\n-   If \\\\(N\\_u < N\\_k\\\\), there are fewer unknowns than known equations. It violates [external stability](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-geometric-stability); hence, the structure is externally unstable.\n### Degree of Indeterminacy\nIf a structure is indeterminate, how many more equations do we need to study its behavior? The degree of indeterminacy \\\\(D\\_i\\\\) tells us exactly that. It's simply the difference between the unknowns and known equations:\n\\\\(D\\_i = N\\_u -N\\_k\\\\)\nAgain, there are three possible scenarios of \\\\(D\\_i\\\\). For example,\n-   If we have a \\\\(D\\_i\\\\) of two, the number of unknowns is greater than the number of known conditions. We would need two more equations to solve the structure.\n-   If \\\\(D\\_i\\\\) is equal to zero, then we won't need additional equations to solve it; hence, we can say that it is determinate.\n-   Lastly, if \\\\(D\\_i\\\\) is a negative number, the number of unknowns is less than the number of known conditions. Meaning it would violate the stability of the structure.\nWe can summarise this example as follows:\n-   \\\\(D\\_i > 0\\\\) means the structure is indeterminate; the number tells us how many additional equations we need more\n-   \\\\(D\\_i = 0\\\\) means the structure is determinate\n-   \\\\(D\\_i < 0\\\\) means the structure is externally unstable\nThis equation can also be an excellent strategy to determine whether a structure is determinate or indeterminate rather than comparing \\\\(N\\_u\\\\) and \\\\(N\\_k\\\\).\n## Summary\n> Statically determinate structures can be analyzed using static equilibrium equations only. Conversely, statically indeterminate structures cannot be analyzed using such equations only.\n> The number of unknowns \\\\(N\\_u\\\\) refers to the number of reactions and internal forces of the structure we need to solve.\n> The number of known conditions \\\\(N\\_k\\\\) refers to the number of equations we know to solve the structure.\n> Comparing \\\\(N\\_u\\\\) and \\\\(N\\_k\\\\) will give the determinacy \\\\(D\\\\) of the structure.\n> The degree of indeterminacy \\\\(D\\_i\\\\) can answer the number of additional equations needed for indeterminate structures and is equal to \\\\(D\\_i = N\\_u - N\\_k\\\\).\n> The equation \\\\(D\\_i = N\\_u - N\\_k\\\\) can help us tell whether the structure is determinate, indeterminate, or unstable.\n",

The segment equations or general equations? It doesn't matter because both groups are the same. The difference lies in how we evaluate the expression.\n-   If we have segment equations, we have a specific domain. We must only substitute \\\\(x\\\\) within the said domain.\n-   If we use general equations, we have [explicitly defined terms](/tree-posts/what-are-explicit-and-implicit-domains). We must neglect particular terms if the value inside the brackets is negative.\nSay we're interested in finding the translation at \\\\(x = 1.8m\\\\). Using the segment deflection equation, we substitute and evaluate the following:\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{x=1.8}=\\frac{1}{E I}(27(1.8)-877.92), 0 \\leq x<2\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{x=1.8}=\\frac{1}{E I}(-829.32)\\\\)\nIf we use the general equation, we have the following:\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}(\\frac{27}{2}\\langle 1.8\\rangle^2+15\\langle 1.8-2\\rangle^3-\\frac{1}{12}\\langle 1.8-2\\rangle^5+\\frac{15}{8}\\langle 1.8-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{1}{12}\\langle 1.8-6.5\\rangle^5-\\frac{3}{2}\\langle 1.8-6.5\\rangle^4\\\\)\n\\\\(+\\frac{3}{2}\\langle 1.8-11\\rangle^4+\\frac{351}{8}\\langle 1.8-11\\rangle^3-877.92\\langle 1.8\\rangle+1701.84)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{x=1.8}=\\frac{1}{E I}(-829.32)\\\\)\n## Slope and Deflection Diagrams\nJust like axial \\\\(N\\\\), shear \\\\(V\\\\), moment \\\\(M\\\\), and torsion \\\\(T\\\\) diagrams, we can [graphically](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-mathematical-functions) express the deflection characteristics of a structure.\nThe following shows the graphical representation of these components.\n‍\nIn this example, the [flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) \\\\(EI\\\\) of the beam example is constant throughout its entire length.\nPlotting the slope equations will lead you to the slope diagram \\\\(\\theta\\\\). If you look closely, a relative [maximum](/tree-posts/what-is-minima-and-maxima) occurs at zero moment point \\\\(x = 10.145\\\\). It signifies a point where there is a change in curvature in the deflected shape.\nSimilarly, plotting the deflection equations will let you draw the deflection diagram. It is the actual shape of the deflected beam when subjected to the given load.\nIn structural design, we're usually interested in finding deflection at critical points, such as the point of maximum deflection. From calculus, a maximum occurs when the tangent drawn to it is zero; hence, the maximum deflection will appear at the zero rotation point \\\\(\\theta = 0\\\\). If you look at the figure, it will occur when \\\\(x = 6.365\\\\) with a value of \\\\(-2223.75 / EI\\\\).\n",

      "Paid Content": "## Setting Up The Pieces\nThe following section shows how we will derive the general virtual work equation. We will set up the expressions needed first.\n### Virtual Structure\n![Virtual beam structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a3f793a9b21d05d7f8f7_WTS-Structure_31.0001-3.png)\nThe first step of the virtual work method is to create a structure similar to our example without the imposed structural loads. This structure will have the unit load we made earlier.\nThis beam is what we call the virtual structure. It acts as a placeholder in solving deflections, which will be more evident when we solve examples.\nAn important thing to note is that the beam remains within the elastic region. To accomplish this, we must place this unit load gradually.\nNow, let's investigate the \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram of the virtual beam and observe the following:\n-   When the unit load was gradually applied, it also caused displacement \\\\(\\delta\\_{C\\_{v}C\\_{v}}\\\\). The unit load caused a  fictional displacement.\n-   As a result of this displacement, there was fictional work: \\\\(W\\_{\\delta}\\\\)\nThis fictional work is the entire work for this system \\\\(W\\_{\\delta}\\\\). From the Law of Conservation of Energy, there must be a transfer of this external work \\\\(W\\_\\delta\\\\) to strain energy \\\\(U\\_\\delta\\\\).

In our example, it is the point load \\\\(F\\\\) at \\\\(C\\\\). \nWhen we superimpose, we combine the responses of both beams. Note that the beam is still in the elastic range since we gradually superimposed the loads.\nOne essential item to note is that the fictional unit load on the beam is constant throughout the superimposition; hence, it is still there, as seen in the \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram.\nSpeaking of such, let's investigate it and observe the following:\n-   The gradual application of the actual loads has caused real deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), \n-   This application caused additional external work \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\Delta}\\\\).\n-   _Since the virtual unit load is constant when the actual load is superimposed, there is also additional work \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\) due to the virtual force and the actual deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\\\)._\nOverall, the total external work \\\\(W\\_T\\\\) done on this system is:\nEquation 2: \\\\(W\\_T=W\\_\\delta+W\\_{s\\_\\Delta}+W\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\)\nAgain, from the Law of Conservation of Energy, there must be strain energy \\\\(U\\\\).

In this example, we applied the loads gradually again. In this way, the beam remains within the elastic range.\nLet's observe the \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram of the real beam:\n-   When the actual loads were gradually applied, it also caused displacement \\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\\\).\n-   As a result, there was real work: \\\\(W\\_{\\Delta}\\\\).\nThe entire work for this system is equal to \\\\(W\\_{\\Delta}\\\\). From energy conservation, there must be a transfer of this external work \\\\(W\\_\\Delta\\\\) to strain energy \\\\(U\\_\\Delta\\\\).\n-   Since actual loads caused this \\\\(U\\\\), we also have non-fictional strain energy.\n-   The strain energy is flexural (more on this soon).\nThe total strain energy is equal to \\\\(U\\_\\Delta\\\\).\nAs a result, we can equate the total external work and strain energy:\nEquation 5: \\\\(W\\_\\Delta=U\\_\\Delta\\\\)\n## Key Concept: General Virtual Work Equation\nLet's look back to our superimposed structure and derive the general virtual work equation. \nConsider Equation 4: the expression of total superimposed work equals total superimposed strain energy.\n\\\\(W\\_\\delta+W\\_{s\\_\\Delta}+W\\_{s\\_\\delta}=U\\_\\delta+U\\_{s\\_\\Delta}+U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\)\nFrom Equations 1 and 5, we can cancel some of the terms of Equation 4. Note that \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\Delta}=W\\_\\Delta\\\\) and \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\Delta=U\\_\\Delta}\\\\). It is true because the superimposed loads are the original loads of the structure.\n\\\\(\\cancel{W\\_\\delta}+\\cancel{W\\_{s\\_\\Delta}}+W\\_{s\\_\\delta}=\\cancel{U\\_\\delta}+\\cancel{U\\_{s\\_\\Delta}}+U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\)\nAs a result, we have the general equation of virtual work:\nGeneral Equation of Virtual Work: \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\delta}=U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\)\nThis equation is what we use to find the deflection of a structure. Generally, this equation tells us that virtual work \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\) is equal to the strain energy \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\).\n![Graphical explanation of general virtual work](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/657432dc4aaadff0f023b404_WTS-8-Deflections_VirtualWork-003.png)\nTo further explain what the equation means, let's look at the \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram of the superimposed structure. If you look at the rectangular parts, the external work and strain energy must be equal.\nFrom this graph, we can say that \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\) is the product of fictional unit load (or couple) and actual translation (or rotation); hence, we can represent the general virtual work equation as:\n\\\\(1\\times(\\Delta\\space{or}\\space\\theta)=U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\)\n## Superimposed Strain Energy\nWe still have another question about the general virtual work equation. What is \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\)? How do we find the area of the rectangular part in the superimposed \\\\(U\\\\)-diagram?\nFrom the graph of the Figure, \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\) is the product of fictional internal forces and actual internal displacements or strains; however, this will entirely depend on the primary type of stress. For example:\n-   [Flexural Strains](/tree-posts/deriving-virtual-work-due-to-flexural-strains)\n-   [Axial Strains](/tree-posts/deriving-virtual-work-due-to-axial-strains)\n-   Torsional Strains\n## Summary\nLet's summarize the derivation of the general virtual work equation:\n> We represent the unknown deflection with a fictitious unit load. Its direction is the same as the assumed direction of our deflection.\n> We create a virtual structure. It acts as a placeholder in solving deflections. We gradually place the unit load on the virtual structure so that it still behaves in the elastic range.\n> Afterward, we gradually superimpose the actual loads on the virtual structure. As a result, the work and energy of the superimposed structure is \\\\(W\\_\\delta+W\\_{s\\_\\Delta}+W\\_{s\\_\\delta}=U\\_\\delta+U\\_{s\\_\\Delta}+U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\).\n> Ultimately, the general virtual work equation is equal to \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\delta}=U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\).\n> \\\\(W\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\) is the product of fictional unit load (or couple) and actual translation (or rotation); hence, the general virtual work equation is \\\\(1\\times(\\Delta\\space{or}\\space\\theta)=U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\).\n> \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\) is the product of fictional internal forces and actual internal displacements or strains; however, this will entirely depend on the primary type of stress: axial, flexural, or torsional.\n",

Now, let's see how we can exactly apply these models.\n## Application\nLet's say we're designing parachutes. Imagine we're making these life-saving devices. Before we can make one, we need to know what is happening with the falling object.\nSay we have an object that fell from the top of a building:\n-   The falling thing has a mass of 65 kg \\\\(m\\\\)\n-   We drop it \\\\(v\\_0=0\\\\) from a height of 800m, initial position \\\\(s\\_0\\\\), from the ground floor.\n-   Gravitational acceleration is 9.81 \\\\(\\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\)\n-   Variable \\\\(k\\\\) is equal to 0.035\n",
      "Paid Content": "From there, we can now describe the motion of this instance. Using these values, we substitute them into the three equations. Below are the corresponding motion graphs of these equations:\n‍\nWe can interact with these graphs to determine the position, velocity, and acceleration of the falling body at any time. Note that velocity is negative, which refers to the object's direction.\nSome notable observations include the following:\n-   From the position-time graph, it will only take 13.705 seconds for the body to reach the ground from a height of 800 m. If you're designing a parachute for this instance, then it means the parachute has to deploy faster than that.\n-   When it has reached the ground, the body has a final velocity of around 103 m/s (371 kph) and a deceleration of about 4.1 m per second squared. That is extremely fast compared to typical speed limits you encounter on expressways. What's more concerning is that it is a fatal crash speed. In parachute design, you must reduce the final impact speed so the user is safe when they reach the ground. That means that designers will need to find a way to make deceleration constant so that it doesn't gain speed, plus the parachute can slow down the fall.\nFrom this application, we can see how we can use these [functions](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) to study the behavior of the free-falling motion with air resistance.\n",

When you cut the truss, you reveal the internal forces of members you would like to solve; afterward, we analyze one or the other part of the truss and solve for these internal bar forces using [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations. As an analogy, it's like [placing a section along the beam](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment) to _reveal_ the shear force \\\\(V\\\\) and bending moment \\\\(M\\\\) at a specific point and then analyzing either the left or right part of the beam to solve for \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\).\n## General Outline\n### Strategically Place the Cutting Plane\n![Position the cutting plane](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cdc63f44a714626684e6_WTS-Structure_21.05-1.png)\nWhenever we use the method of sections, as a general rule, place a cutting plane through a maximum of three members. For 2D trusses, we can only apply [three equilibrium equations](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium); hence we can only have a maximum of three unknowns. \nWhen we place a cutting plane that will cut these members, it will divide the truss into two free-body diagrams (FBD). The cut members will have all internal forces exposed (typically assumed tension at the start).\n### All Parts of the Structure Must Be In Equilibrium\n![All divided parts must be in equilibrium](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cdcfa50b9c479663466b_WTS-Structure_21.05-2.png)\nSince we have divided the truss into two parts, we can choose either one or the other part to solve for bar forces.\nTo solve for the cut forces, remember that this structure must be in equilibrium. It must be true also for the divided parts. We can learn more about this through an example.\n### Repeat Analysis\nWhen you finally solve the cut bar forces, you can find another section and repeat the process until you've solved every member. Midway, you can switch to the method of joints if you prefer.\n## Tips\n-   Again, you can analyze either one part or the other. You can also use the other part as a check to your solution whether your computations are correct.\n-   When revealing bar forces, it is an excellent strategy to have a uniform assumption in terms of direction to avoid confusion later. Generally, we assume it to be tension (away from the joint).\n-   Identifying the points of intersection of all bar forces we cut BEFORE proceeding with the equilibrium analysis is a good idea. These points of intersection are usually the best pivot points for all force components when applying the moment equilibrium condition. \n-   Try to identify points of intersection that will eliminate as many internal forces as possible.\n-   The method of sections makes it easy to solve for internal forces of horizontal parallel trusses such as the [Warren truss](/tree-posts/what-are-common-truss-types) (top and bottom chords are parallel). When we apply the equation of equilibrium to one part of the truss and apply the equilibrium condition along the y-axis, you'll only have one unknown since the two chords are parallel with the x-axis.\n-   It is possible to solve for the bar forces of a truss with a section that will cut four or more members because members are concurrent or collinear - an example of this is the [K-truss](/tree-posts/what-are-common-truss-types), as shown below. We place a section that will cut four members and apply the moment equilibrium condition with the pivot point at the intersection of the corner left of a panel - you'll notice that these three forces pass through this point; hence, we eliminate three out of four. As a result, you can directly solve for the one unknown force immediately.\n![Example of K-Truss section](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cdd83f44a7b2d2668652_WTS-Structure_21.05-3.png)\n## Summarise Your Results\nAfter analysis, it is always a good idea to summarise your results using a table.\n## Application\n-   Let's illustrate how to use the Method of Sections to solve bar forces for a [simple truss](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-sections).\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> We can use the method of sections to solve for the internal bar forces of a truss structure.\n> The method of sections revolves around dividing the truss into two parts by strategically cutting it with a plane. Each division must be in a state of equilibrium.\n> We first strategically put a cutting plane to expose at most three internal bar forces. Afterward, we choose one part of the divided truss and solve these exposed forces by applying the equilibrium principle.\n",

One important thing to note is that these shapes' widths are the difference between two \\\\(x\\\\) positions along the grid line \\\\(w\\_1=x\\_1-x\\_0\\\\), \\\\(w\\_2=x\\_2-x\\_1\\\\), and \\\\(w\\_3=x\\_3-x\\_2\\\\)\nIf we let the areas of these three divisions be \\\\(A\\_1\\\\), \\\\(A\\_2\\\\), and \\\\(A\\_3\\\\), the approximate area \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) would be the sum of these three areas.\n\\\\(A\\_T \\approx A\\_1 + A\\_2 + ... + A\\_n \\approx \\sum\\_{i=1}^n A\\_i\\\\)\nThis solution is an excellent approach to the problem. How well the approximation depends on the number of divisions made for the figure. From this example, we can observe the following:\n-   The more rectangles \\\\(n\\\\), the more closely it would lead to the actual value. \n-   As \\\\(n\\\\) increases, these rectangles' width and area become smaller. \n-   We approach the exact value more closely as the width and area get smaller.\n## Exact Solution\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e358b78aa792f6229dd76e_WTS-1-Mathematics_AreaBetweenCurves-2.png)\nThe solution above is good if we want a rough answer; however, if we want a more precise answer, then integration comes in.\nFrom the approximate solution, we know that if we want an exact answer, the width and area of its divisions must be so small. Building from this, we can solve the precise area. We will only need to modify two things in the approximate solution: \n-   We need to set up a rectangular division that is so small that we can express its area as the differential \\\\(dA\\\\)\n-   We need an operation that will sum up all of these tiny divisions\nWe can combine all \\\\(dA\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the region \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) between two functions is:\n\\\\(A\\_T=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dA}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) is the total area between the two functions\n-   \\\\(dA\\\\) is the differential area of the division.\n-   \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value)\n-   \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\n### Differential Strip\n![The differential strip](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e358c8b28bd5f148b0b0f1_WTS-1-Mathematics_AreaBetweenCurves-3.png)\nLet's expand on this small division with differential area \\\\(dA\\\\). We call this rectangle the differential strip, which consists of a base and height that we call the differential width and length, respectively. The two will depend on the orientation of the strip.\nThis differential width \\\\(dw\\\\) is the difference between two positions \\\\(x\\_A\\\\) and \\\\(x\\_B\\\\), and it is so tiny that it's nearly equal to zero but not precisely zero. It's so small that rather than using \\\\(x\\_A\\\\) and \\\\(x\\_B\\\\) to represent the two positions, we can describe the width with a single position \\\\(x\\\\)\n#### Vertical Orientation\nWhen the width is along the x-axis, we say that the differential strip is in the vertical position. The differential width and length are oriented as follows:\n-   The differential width \\\\(dx\\\\) takes positions along the x-axis. It would take the endpoints along this axis as its lower and upper limit.\n-   We take the length from the y-axis. In this orientation, it's the height difference \\\\(y\\\\) between the two functions.\nFrom this, we can say the length is equal to \\\\(y=f(x)-g(x)\\\\). The area of the differential strip is then: \\\\(dA=ydx\\\\). We can further expand the integration equation as follows:\n\\\\(A\\_T=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}ydx\\\\)\n-   \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) is the total area of the region\n-   \\\\(x\\_1\\\\) is the lower limit along the x-axis\n-   \\\\(x\\_2\\\\) is the upper limit along the x-axis\n-   \\\\(y\\\\) is the length between the two functions (difference between functions along y)\n-   \\\\(dx\\\\) is differential along x\n#### Horizontal Orientation\nWhen the width is along the y-axis, we say that the differential strip is in the horizontal position. The differential width and length are oriented as follows:\n-   The differential width \\\\(dy\\\\) takes positions along the y-axis. It would take the endpoints along this axis as its lower and upper limit.\n-   We take the length from the x-axis. In this orientation, it's the width difference \\\\(x\\\\) between the two functions.\nFrom this, we can say the width is equal to \\\\(x=f(y)-g(y)\\\\). The area of the differential strip is then: \\\\(dA=xdy\\\\). We can further expand the integration equation as follows:\n\\\\(A\\_T=\\int\\_{y\\_1}^{y\\_2}xdy\\\\)\n-   \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) is the total area of the region\n-   \\\\(y\\_1\\\\) is the lower limit along the y-axis\n-   \\\\(y\\_2\\\\) is the upper limit along the y-axis\n-   \\\\(x\\\\) is the width between the two functions (difference between functions along x)\n-   \\\\(dy\\\\) is differential along y\n## Summary\n> Solving the area by integration expands on the approximation solution.\n> The logic is to subdivide the space needed with multiple divisions, solve for the area of each part, and add all of these areas.\n> To improve accuracy, the area of a part must be small enough. To find the exact answer, we must express the area as differential \\\\(dA\\\\)\n> We can combine all \\\\(dA\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the region \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) between two functions is: \\\\(A\\_T=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dA}\\\\). \\\\(A\\_T\\\\) is the total area between the two functions, \\\\(dA\\\\) is the differential area of the division, \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value), and \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\n> The rectangle with area \\\\(dA\\\\) is the differential strip, which consists of a base and height that we call the differential width and length.\n> For a vertically oriented differential strip, the area is equal to: \\\\(A\\_T=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}ydx\\\\).

      "Free Content": "In this post, we introduce the concept of relations. To begin, we'll start with sets.\n## What is a Set?\nA set is a collection of similar things or \"elements.\" For example:\n-   We can have a group of countries of the world (USA, UK, Japan, France)\n-   Another set would be the cities around the world (New York City, London, Tokyo, Paris).\n-   It can be a set of real numbers (from 0 to infinity)\nThe values in the set are sometimes called objects. \n## What is a Relation?\n![A relation is a link between sets](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e3317cdf2f6848c89e0fd1_WTS-1-Mathematics_IntroductionToRelations-1.png)\nNow that we know what sets are, it's easier to define a \"relation\" – a link between \"sets.\"\nLet's consider the set of countries and cities. Wouldn't you agree that there is a relationship between the objects of these two sets? Like New York City to the USA, Tokyo to Japan, London to the UK, Paris to France, etc. In this case, this \"connection\" between these two groups is what we meant by a relation.\n### Notation\nUsually, we express relations in ordered pairs \\\\((x, y)\\\\), such as:\n-   (New York City, USA)\n-   (Tokyo, Japan)\n-   (London, UK)\n-   (Paris, France)\n-   (0, 0)\n### Domain and Range\nWhen discussing relations, one will often encounter the terms domain and range. We start by defining what are independent and dependent sets.\n#### Independent and Dependent Sets\n![Area-radius relation with area as dependent set](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e331ad1e409728d89cae04_WTS-1-Mathematics_IntroductionToRelations-2.png)\nEvery relation would have at least two sets. One set would depend entirely on the other.\nTo clarify, let's look at the relationship between the radius of a circle \\\\(r\\\\) and its area \\\\(A\\\\). The relation between these two sets is \\\\(A=\\pi{r^2}\\\\). \n-   If we input a radius (r) of 1 into the formula, we will get an area \\\\(A\\\\) of \\\\(\\pi\\\\) square units. Consequently, if we enter another radius \\\\(r\\\\) as long as it is any value from zero to any positive actual number, we would get a new area \\\\(A\\\\).\nWith this example, area depends on radius. We can't have an area \\\\(A\\\\) without the radius \\\\(r\\\\). In this case, the radius is the independent variable (because it can stand independently), while the area is the dependent variable (because it depends on the radius).\nGoing back to domain and range, we call the independent set of values the domain, while the dependent set the range. In our relation \\\\(A=\\pi{r^2}\\\\):\n-   The domain (independent variable) is the set of values for radius \\\\(r\\\\),\n-   The range (dependent variable) is the set of values for area \\\\(A\\\\).\n#### Domain and Range Would Depend on the Relation\n![Area-radius relation with radius as dependent set](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e331c86b8d852286bd0d69_WTS-1-Mathematics_IntroductionToRelations-3.png)\nSupposedly, we transform the area formula so that we're interested in finding the radius. By transposing, we get: \\\\(r=\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}}\\\\)\nIn this case, you can't have a radius without giving an area. It's the reverse of the earlier example; As such, the domain and range would also be the reverse:\n-   The domain (independent variable) is the set of values for area \\\\(A\\\\), \n-   The range (dependent variable) is the set of values for radius \\\\(r\\\\).\nFrom this, the domain and range would depend entirely on how we look at the relation.\n### How Do Relations Behave?\n![Types of relations](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e331da0f735ac60e8b50b9_WTS-1-Mathematics_IntroductionToRelations-4.png)\nRelations can be any of four types: \n-   One-to-one\n-   One-to-many\n-   Many-to-one\n-   Many-to-many\n#### One-to-One\n_An object of one set corresponds to only one element of the other set._ \n-   An example is a relation between people (domain) and their fingerprints (range). There are billions of people in the world, and each person has a unique pattern of fingerprints. Ideally, there can't be any two persons having the same fingerprints.\n#### One-to-Many\n_An object of one set corresponds to many elements of the other set._\n-   A perfect example would be the square numbers (domain) and their roots (range). From mathematics, if we take the square root of a number, there are two values in the positive and negative sense. For example, if we take the square root of 4, we will have +2 and -2. There is only one entry in the domain (square numbers), but it links to two entries in the range (its roots).\n#### Many-to-One\n_Objects of one set correspond to only one element of the other set._ \n-   A good example would be the link between integers (domain) and square numbers (range). For instance, the square of -1 and +1 is 1, the square of -2 and +2 is 4, the square of -3 and +3 is 9, and so on. We can say it's the reverse of \"one-to-many.\"\n#### Many-to-Many\n_Objects of one set correspond to many elements of the other set._\n-   An example is the set of customers (domain) and the products they bought (range). Customers can purchase many products, while products are bought by multiple customers.\n## Summary\n> A set is a collection of similar things or \"elements.\"\n> A \"relation\" is a link between \"sets.\"\n> We express relations in ordered pairs \\\\((x, y)\\\\)\n> Every relation would have at least two sets. One set would depend entirely on the other.\n> We call the independent set of values the domain, while the dependent set the range.\n> The domain and range depend entirely on how we look at the relation.\n> Relations can be any of four types: (1) one-to-one, (2) one-to-many, (3) many-to-one, and (4) many-to-many.\n> One-to-one relation: _An object of one set corresponds to only one element of the other set._ \n> One-to-many relation: _An object of one set corresponds to many elements of the other set._\n> Many-to-one relation: _Objects of one set correspond to only one element of the other set._\n> Many-to-many: _Objects of one set correspond to many elements of the other set._\n",

Here are the following:\n## Classical Approach\nThe classical approach revolves around using principles from [Mechanics](/tree-posts/mechanics). To name a few of these methods, we have the [Method of Joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) and [Sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections) for trusses, the General Method for indeterminate structures, and the Moment Distribution Method.\nIn this approach, engineers solve problems by hand. Most structural engineering classes would start with this style. This approach gives students a good idea of how structures work. Once they have a solid understanding, they move on to the following approach.\n## Matrix Approach\nThe matrix approach studies the structure's behavior using vectors and matrices. It is an evolution of the previous style.\nWhen structures were getting larger and larger, there was a need to provide faster and more precise results; however, its challenging to meet such demand using the last method. So, the question is, how can engineers deliver? \nThat's where matrices and computers come in. Matrices can represent a lot of concepts in the classical approach. For example, one can make a matrix of the structure's geometry and loads, to name a few. Since computers are great at performing computations on these, the matrix approach made it easy to have faster and more accurate analyses.\n## Summary\n> There are several approaches in structural analysis. Examples include the classical and matrix approach.\n> The classical approach revolves around using principles from Mechanics.\n> The matrix approach studies the structure's behavior using vectors and matrices.\n",

We derive both by making parallelism with two equations: (1) the modified standard form and (2) the product rule.\nTo begin, let's create the modified standard form.

From this, we can change the expression to:\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}(y \\mu)=\\mu b(x)\\\\)\nWe can then integrate both sides and isolate \\\\(y\\\\) to get the general solution expression.\n-   \\\\(\\int d(y \\mu)=\\int \\mu b(x) d x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y \\mu=\\int \\mu b(x) d x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int \\mu b(x) d x\\\\)\n## Example\nConsider the differential equation: \\\\(y^\\prime + xy = x\\\\) and solve for a general solution. \n### Investigate DE\nFirst, we would investigate if this DE observes the form: \\\\(y^\\prime + a(x)y = b(x)\\\\). In this case:\n-   \\\\(a(x) = x\\\\) \n-   \\\\(b(x) = x\\\\).\nThe form follows the standard format; hence, we can use the integrating factor and the general solution equation.\n### Apply Method\nFirst, we find the integrating factor \\\\(\\mu\\\\):\n-   \\\\(\\mu=e^{\\int a(x) d x}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\mu=e^{\\int x d x}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\mu=e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\\\)\nFinally, using the general solution expression, we obtain the following:\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int \\mu b(x) d x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{1}{e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}} \\int x e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}} d x\\\\)\nThe problem is now an integration problem. We solve for it to generate the general solution to the DE.\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{1}{e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}}\\left(e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}+C\\right)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=1+C e^{\\frac{-x^2}{2}}\\\\)\n## Summary\n> An equation of the form \\\\(y^\\prime + a(x)y = b(x)\\\\) is a first-order linear differential equation (DE) (also known as the standard form of a differential equation).

      "Free Content": "Continuing from this [example](/tree-posts/how-to-perform-beam-analysis), let's learn how to use the [double integration method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-double-integration-method) to model the beam's deflection. We shall model it as a whole for this example. For the alternative solution, click [here](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-double-integration-method-using-segment-analysis).\n_The solution presented is in SI. The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\n## Main Solution\nThere are two ways to solve this problem using the double integration method: [segment](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-double-integration-method-using-segment-analysis) and general equation analysis. \nWhile the former is a unique approach, it's cumbersome, especially with multiple loads. In this post, we'll explore the latter.\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Set Up General Equations\nIn this method, we will analyze the beam as a whole. To start, we would need to formulate general \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\), and \\\\(I\\\\) equations - [expressions](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) that would include all bending effects, changes in material, and cross-section properties for the beam.\nSince we have assumed that \\\\(E\\\\) and \\\\(I\\\\) are constant for the whole beam, we'll only concentrate on creating a general moment \\\\(M\\\\) equation.\n#### General Moment Equation\nThe first step is to create a [moment equation](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment) encompassing all bending effects of each load. This single equation allows us to find \\\\(M\\\\) at any point.\nCreating one is similar to forming any moment equation on any segment. To construct it, we have to:\n1.  Place the cutting plane at the last point of the beam. Doing this would divide the beam into two parts: the left with all loading conditions and the right part, which is the last joint.\n2.  Choose the left part and create a moment equation for all loads on the side.\nThe left side of the section has only five loads; we only consider these effects:\n-   \\\\(M\\_1=27\\\\) is due to the \\\\(27 kN•m\\\\) couple at \\\\(A\\\\)\n-   \\\\(M\\_2=90\\langle x-2\\rangle\\\\) is due to the \\\\(90kN\\\\) reaction at \\\\(B\\\\)\n-   \\\\(M\\_3=-\\frac{5}{3}\\langle x-2\\rangle^3+\\frac{45}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^2+\\frac{5}{3}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3\\\\) is due to the \\\\(45 kN/m\\\\) uniform varying load between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\)\n-   \\\\(M\\_4=-18\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^2+18\\langle x-11\\rangle^2\\\\) is due to the \\\\(36 kN/m\\\\) uniform distributed load between \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\)\n-   \\\\(M\\_5=\\frac{1053}{4}\\langle x-11\\rangle\\\\) is due to the \\\\(263.25 kN\\\\) reaction at \\\\(D\\\\)\nThe sum of these will lead us to the general moment equation:\n\\\\(M\\_x=\\sum\\_{i=1}^n=M\\_1+M\\_2+\\cdots+M\\_n\\\\)\n\\\\(M=27+90\\langle x-2\\rangle-\\frac{5}{3}\\langle x-2\\rangle^3+\\frac{45}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^2+\\frac{5}{3}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3\\\\)\n\\\\(-18\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^2+18\\langle x-11\\rangle^2+\\frac{1053}{4}\\langle x-11\\rangle\\\\)\nOne important thing to note is that this equation must be in this form.\nThe domain is from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(L\\\\), which is the beam's length; however, we must note that the terms are [explicitly defined](/tree-posts/what-are-explicit-and-implicit-domains).\n#### Explicitly-Defined Terms\nTo explain what is meant by explicitly defined terms, let's test our equation.\nSay that we are interested in finding the moment when \\\\(x = 1\\\\). One may insert \\\\(x=1\\\\) into our general equation to get \\\\(M\\\\) at that point, but doing so will lead to a wrong answer. The correct \\\\(M\\\\) value is \\\\(27kN•m\\\\) based on the moment equation of \\\\(AB\\\\).\n\\\\(27 \\neq 27+90\\langle 1-2\\rangle-\\frac{5}{3}\\langle 1-2\\rangle^3+\\frac{45}{2}\\langle 1-6.5\\rangle^2+\\frac{5}{3}\\langle 1-6.5\\rangle^3\\\\)\n\\\\(-18\\langle 1-6.5\\rangle^2+18\\langle 1-11\\rangle^2+\\frac{1053}{4}\\langle 1-11\\rangle\\\\)\nTo explain what went wrong, let's look at our equation closer. Each term represents \\\\(M\\\\) of a load as specified in \\\\(M\\_1\\\\), \\\\(M\\_2\\\\), \\\\(M\\_3\\\\), \\\\(M\\_4\\\\), and \\\\(M\\_5\\\\). If we substitute \\\\(x=1\\\\) into the equation and evaluate the result, we would consider the bending effects of ALL loading conditions, which is wrong.\nTo get the correct one, we should only consider terms relevant to \\\\(x=1\\\\) and disregard others. To help us remember this condition, we have intentionally replaced the parenthesis with angle brackets for terms involving the position \\\\(x\\\\).\nIf the value inside the brackets is negative, we don't consider it. So, evaluating the general equation with \\\\(x=1\\\\) will lead to:\n\\\\(M\\_{x=1}=27\\\\)\nThis result is similar to the moment equation at \\\\(AB\\\\).\n### Apply Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation\nWith the general equation set-up, we can apply the [Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation](/tree-posts/what-is-the-bernoulli-euler-beam-theory). If we have any functions of \\\\(E\\\\) and \\\\(I\\\\), we should also consider it here:\n\\\\(\\frac{d^2 \\Delta}{d x^2}=\\frac{1}{E I}(27+90\\langle x-2\\rangle-\\frac{5}{3}\\langle x-2\\rangle^3+\\frac{45}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^2+\\frac{5}{3}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3\\\\)\n\\\\(-18\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^2+18\\langle x-11\\rangle^2+\\frac{1053}{4}\\langle x-11\\rangle)\\\\)\n### Find General Solution\nAfterward, we are ready to find the [general](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation-solution) slope and deflection equations.\n#### General Slope Equations\nLet's start by finding the general slope equation. We integrate the Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation once to get it:\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(27\\langle x\\rangle+45\\langle x-2\\rangle^2-\\frac{5}{12}\\langle x-2\\rangle^4+\\frac{15}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3+\\frac{5}{12}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-6\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3+6\\langle x-11\\rangle^3+\\frac{1053}{8}\\langle x-11\\rangle^2+C\\_1\\right)\\\\)\n#### General Deflection Equations\nAfter getting the slope equation, we integrate it again to get the general deflection equation:\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(\\frac{27}{2}\\langle x\\rangle^2+15\\langle x-2\\rangle^3-\\frac{1}{12}\\langle x-2\\rangle^5+\\frac{15}{8}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{1}{12}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^5\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-\\frac{3}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{3}{2}\\langle x-11\\rangle^4+\\frac{351}{8}\\langle x-11\\rangle^3+C\\_1\\langle x\\rangle+C\\_2\\right)\\\\)\n### Find Particular Solution\nIn this example, we need to solve only two constants of integration \\\\(C\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_2\\\\). As we did in segment analysis, we create conditions first.\n#### Conditions\nConditions are constraints or facts that we know about the structure. The number of conditions we need is equal to the number of constants of integration. So, if we have two constants, we need at least two conditions.\n##### Boundary Conditions\n[Boundary conditions](/tree-posts/what-are-boundary-conditions) deal with restrictions at the supports. For example, fixed supports in ideal cantilevers or restrained beams do not permit deflection.\nLet's continue with our analysis. We know the vertical translation at the roller \\\\(B (2, 0)\\\\) is restricted. We can use this to create one condition.\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{B\\_v}=0, x=2\\\\)\nBefore evaluating, it's essential to note that the terms are explicitly defined. We must disregard some terms if the values inside the brackets are negative.\n\\\\(0=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(\\frac{27}{2}\\langle 2\\rangle^2+15\\langle 2-2\\rangle^3-\\frac{1}{12}\\langle 2-2\\rangle^5+\\frac{15}{8}\\langle 2-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{1}{12}\\langle 2-6.5\\rangle^5\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-\\frac{3}{2}\\langle 2-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{3}{2}\\langle 2-11\\rangle^4+\\frac{351}{8}\\langle 2-11\\rangle^3+C\\_1\\langle 2\\rangle+C\\_2\\right)\\\\)\nBoundary Condition 1: \\\\(2 C\\_1+C\\_2=-54\\\\)\nFor the other condition, we look at \\\\(D (11, 0)\\\\) or the hinge support. Since vertical translation is not allowed, we use this to form the other condition:\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{D\\_v}=0, x=11\\\\)\n\\\\(0=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(\\frac{27}{2}\\langle 11\\rangle^2+15\\langle 11-2\\rangle^3-\\frac{1}{12}\\langle 11-2\\rangle^5+\\frac{15}{8}\\langle 11-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{1}{12}\\langle 11-6.5\\rangle^5\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-\\frac{3}{2}\\langle 11-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{3}{2}\\langle 11-11\\rangle^4+\\frac{351}{8}\\langle 11-11\\rangle^3+C\\_1\\langle 11\\rangle+C\\_2\\right)\\\\)\nBoundary Condition 2: \\\\(11 C\\_1+C\\_2=\\frac{509139}{64}\\\\)\n#### Solving the Constants of Integration\nWith these two conditions, we are now ready to solve for \\\\(C\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_2\\\\).\nUsing algebra, we have:\n\\\\(C\\_1=-877.92\\\\)\n\\\\(C\\_2=1701.84\\\\)\n### Summarize Equations\nWith constants of integration solved, the final step is to summarize the equations by substituting constants of integration:\n#### Slope Equation\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(27\\langle x\\rangle+45\\langle x-2\\rangle^2-\\frac{5}{12}\\langle x-2\\rangle^4+\\frac{15}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3+\\frac{5}{12}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-6\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3+6\\langle x-11\\rangle^3+\\frac{1053}{8}\\langle x-11\\rangle^2-877.92\\right)\\\\)\n#### Deflection Equation\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(\\frac{27}{2}\\langle x\\rangle^2+15\\langle x-2\\rangle^3-\\frac{1}{12}\\langle x-2\\rangle^5+\\frac{15}{8}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{1}{12}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^5\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-\\frac{3}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4+\\frac{3}{2}\\langle x-11\\rangle^4+\\frac{351}{8}\\langle x-11\\rangle^3-877.92\\langle x\\rangle+1701.84\\right)\\\\)\nThe equations above are the slope and deflection of the beam example with explicitly defined terms. With this, you can determine the rotation or translation at any beam point.\nFrom this example, we can see the benefits of using this method over the [other](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-double-integration-method-using-segment-analysis). We only need one equation to make rather than per segment, and we have fewer conditions to formulate.\n## General and Segment Equations\nLet's recall the beam limits per segment.\n-   AB: \\\\(0 \\leq {x} \\lt 2\\\\)\n-   BC: \\\\(2 \\leq {x} \\lt 6.5\\\\)\n-   CD: \\\\(6.5 \\leq {x} \\lt 11\\\\)\n-   DE: \\\\(11 \\leq {x} \\lt 12.5\\\\)\nWe can use these limits to find the [segment equation](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-double-integration-method-using-segment-analysis) from the general expression.\nAs an example, let's evaluate the general slope equation with \\\\(BC: 2 \\leq {x} \\lt 6.5\\\\) as our limits:\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(27\\langle x\\rangle+45\\langle x-2\\rangle^2-\\frac{5}{12}\\langle x-2\\rangle^4+\\frac{15}{2}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3+\\frac{5}{12}\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^4\\right.\\\\)\n\\\\(\\left.-6\\langle x-6.5\\rangle^3+6\\langle x-11\\rangle^3+\\frac{1053}{8}\\langle x-11\\rangle^2-877.92\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{12} x^4+\\frac{10}{3} x^3+35 x^2-\\frac{419}{3} x-704.59\\right)\\\\)\nThis result is similar to the segmented slope equation.\n## Slope and Deflection Diagrams\nWe can represent these equations using a graph. If we plot the slope \\\\(\\theta\\\\) against position \\\\(x\\\\) and deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) against \\\\(x\\\\), we get the slope and deflection diagrams of the structure.\n‍\nThese diagrams assume the beam example's [flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) \\\\(EI\\\\) is constant.\n",

This post explains the basics of it:\n## Extrema: Minima and Maxima\n‍\nMost function graphs will have extrema (singular: extremum). These are the maximum and minimum points along its curve. \n-   The maximum is the point along the graph at the \"top of the hill.\"\n-   The minimum is the point along the graph at the \"bottom of the valley.\"\nFor example, in the [sine graph](/tree-posts/what-are-trigonometric-functions) \\\\(f(x)=\\sin x\\\\), we say that at 90 degrees, located at \\\\((\\frac{\\pi}{2},1)\\\\), is the maximum point of the graph (since it is the apex point of the function). The point at \\\\((\\frac{3\\pi}{2},-1)\\\\) is the minimum point of the graph.\nLet's formalize the definition of maximum and minimum. Consider a graph of a function \\\\(f\\\\) with an interval, either closed or open.

If the first derivative is impossible to obtain (like for sharp-pointed graphs), it is also an extremum.\nLet's note that not all functions have an extrema. An example of which is a horizontal line.\n## Absolute and Relative\n![Extrema of a function](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35c4f6084d30adaad0e89_WTS-1-Mathematics_Extrema-1.png)\nThere are two types of extrema: absolute and relative.\n-   An extrema is absolute if the value of \\\\(f(c)\\\\) is the highest/lowest for all possible \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n-   An extrema is relative if \\\\(f(c)\\\\) is the highest/lowest for a specific interval. \nTo illustrate the difference, let's consider a sample graph of a function and make several observations:\n-   Four extrema are located at points \\\\(c\\_1\\\\), \\\\(c\\_2\\\\), \\\\(c\\_3\\\\), and \\\\(c\\_4\\\\).\n-   Extrema \\\\(c\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(c\\_3\\\\) are maximum while \\\\(c\\_2\\\\) and \\\\(c\\_4\\\\) are minimum.\n-   Between \\\\(c\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(c\\_3\\\\), \\\\(c\\_1\\\\) is the absolute maximum because it is the highest point among all other values.\n-   Between \\\\(c\\_2\\\\) and \\\\(c\\_4\\\\), \\\\(c\\_4\\\\) is the absolute minimum because it is the lowest point among all other values.\n-   When we consider an interval along the function, say the shaded interval, point \\\\(c\\_2\\\\) is a relative minimum in the interval.\n-   If we consider the same interval, point \\\\(c\\_3\\\\) is a relative maximum.\n## Critical Numbers\nThe x-value of the extremum is called the critical number \\\\(c\\\\). From this, we can designate the points of maximum and minimum as coordinate \\\\((c, f(c))\\\\). These values are essential when it comes to many applications of differentiation, such as [optimization](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-optimization-problems).\n## Summary\n> Most function graphs will have extrema (singular: extremum).

Unlike the structural model, it is a simple representation using points, lines, and planes. Each represents a part of the model. For example,\n-   A point is a joint.\n-   A line is a member coinciding with its centroidal axis.\n-   A plane is a panel.\nLike the structural model, this helps you see how components are connected (with fewer details). What makes it unique is that this model acts as the basis for all analysis and design. In short, it is an **analysis** or a **mathematical model**.\n## Use of the Analytical Model\nThe primary use of this model is to predict the structure's behavior.

These two extremes make modeling \"a balancing game.\" The most important thing is that it should serve as an accurate and reliable source of a structure's behavior.\nCreating a model would also depend on the behavior one wants to observe. It is noteworthy that engineers may create _multiple_ models for the same structure - for instance, one may make a model with one set of loads and a new model for another group. Each of those would generate unique behavior of the structure.\n## What Should An Analytical Model Contain?\nThe model should have all components modeled with their respective points, lines, and planes and their properties:\n1.  **Geometry.** The joint locations from a point. The end and intersection points of members and panels. The position of supports.\n2.  **Properties.** The member's properties, materials, the panel's thickness, the joint's rigidity, and the support type.\n3.  **Behavior.** How should each component transfer loads? What kind of stresses are allowed for this member?\n## Summary\n> An analytical model is an analysis model which serves as a basis for predicting the structure's behavior.\n> The model must include all major components of the structure. Minute details that would not heavily affect its behavior are generally not included.\n> When creating a model, the most important thing is that it should serve as an accurate and reliable source to describe the structure's behavior.\n> The model should have all components modeled with their respective symbols (points, lines, and planes) and their properties.\n",

      "Free Content": "The [first step in the structural analysis and design cycle](/tree-posts/how-to-design-structures) is to create the structure's skeleton. Typically, the structural engineer would make an initial design based on the architect's plans - place the positions of foundations, columns, and beams, make sections and details for each component, and assign materials. Whatever output that may be is what we call the structural model.\n## Structural Model\n![A skyscraper and its structural model](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e543099ad882505a0b5ba_WTS-Structure_4-1.png)\nThe structural model is an engineer's solution to a structural problem.\nAt the start, the engineer would create a layout that one believes would be the building's skeleton. Afterward, one tests this model. Engineers must ensure that the structure supports the [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads) it may experience and carries out its intended purposes. If there are errors in the design, the engineer will make corrections to the structural model. This process repeats until one reaches an optimum design.\n## How Do Engineers Model?\nThe structural model would depend on the purpose, aesthetics, budget, and environment, culture, to name a few.\nLet's say we are to create a frame for a house near a beach. It is wise to develop a structure NOT made of steel since it's a coastal area - prone to corrosion. Having relatively large footings and tie beams may be a great idea if the soil is sandy. If the house is one level, we won't need industrial-sized sections for beams or columns.\nFrom our example, you can see how certain factors influence the structural skeleton. It's a skill that requires experience.\n## Components\n![Four main components of a structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5452a69b3e6391129745_WTS-Structure_4-2.png)\nLet's recall that a structure is an assemblage of multiple components. Generally, there are four: (1) [members](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member), (2) [joints](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections), (3) [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), and (4) panels. Together, engineers arrange these components [in a fixed reference](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references) to create a safe and functional structure.\n### Members\nA structural member is a one-dimensional relatively long, slender object that carries loads. Physically, it can represent a simple beam, column, bracings, or truss member. A member usually consists of a cross-sectional shape running along two points. It can vary on a lot of properties:\n-   [Longitudinal properties](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-longitudinally)\n-   [Cross-sectional properties](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section)\nAnother aspect, aside from their properties, is their behavior under structural loads, which would depend on the [type of structure](/tree-posts/investigating-the-fundamental-structures).\n### Joints\nJoints are the end or intersection points of members. Other similar names for it are _nodes_ or _connections_.\nThese components behave based on rigidity which can be [rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections).\n### Supports\n[Supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) are objects used to carry structural loads. In real life, these can be the building's foundation or a retaining wall. It can be a simple point applied to a joint, a line segment along a member, or a plane surface along panels.\nAside from carrying structural loads, it also controls deflection - an often understated idea. For example, a fixed support at the structure's base would prevent the building from moving or rotating at that particular point.\n### Panels\nPanels (or shells) are two-dimensional surfaces. These can be slabs, walls, roofs, and claddings, to name a few. In terms of function, they are similar to members - components designed to carry loads.\n## Summary\n> The structural model is an engineer's solution to a structural problem.\n> The structural model would depend on many factors.\n> Generally, there are four components of a structure: (1) members, (2) joints, (3) supports, and (4) panels.\n> Members are relatively long and slender objects that carry loads.\n> Joints are the end or intersection points of structural members.\n> Supports are objects used to carry loads.

      "Free Content": "Remembering the different [trigonometric identities](/tree-posts/trigonometric-identities) can be a difficult task. \nOne way to make things easier is to create a tool to help us recall it. This post will discuss the hexagon trigonometric tool we'll use to identify multiple identities.\n## Hexagon Mnemonic\nTo create the tool, follow these steps:\n-   First, draw a hexagon. The bottom edge of it must be perpendicular to you.\n-   Next, starting from the top-left vertex, label each vertex around the hexagon clockwise with the functions in order: [sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent.](/tree-posts/what-is-the-right-triangle)\n-   Then, place inside the polygon the value one. \nVoila! We just created the hexagon drawing - it should be similar to the figure below:\n![Hexagon mnemonic](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35688ef350ee5a8efc095_WTS-1-Mathematics_HexagonMnemonic-1.png)\nNow that we have this tool, we can derive different identities\n### Reciprocal Identity\n![Reciprocal identities](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e3569c4f1eb6cf3becb91f_WTS-1-Mathematics_HexagonMnemonic-2.png)\nWe first start with the simplest one: the reciprocal identity. As you recall, there are six trigonometric functions.\nOne key observation is that the first three functions, \\\\(\\sin\\\\), \\\\(\\cos\\\\), and \\\\(\\tan\\\\), are the reciprocals of the other three, \\\\(\\csc\\\\), \\\\(\\sec\\\\), and \\\\(\\cot\\\\). These are what we call reciprocal identities.\nLet's go back to our drawing. Where do we see it? Consider a line connecting two directly opposite vertices and investigate the functions along the line. For example, let's use the diagonal connecting \\\\(\\sin\\theta\\\\), 1, and \\\\(\\csc\\theta\\\\).\n-   If you read the line from sine downwards, the identity is \\\\(\\sin\\theta=\\frac{1}{\\csc\\theta}\\\\)\n-   If you read the line from cosecant upwards, the identity is \\\\(\\csc\\theta=\\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\\\)\nThis example shows how to read said identities: when a line connects two directly opposite vertices, they are reciprocals. \nFrom this, there are only three possible lines: \\\\(\\sin-\\csc\\\\), \\\\(\\cos-\\sec\\\\), and \\\\(\\tan-\\cot\\\\).\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Quotient Identity\n![Quotient identities](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e356ac93cc742996ecf555_WTS-1-Mathematics_HexagonMnemonic-3.png)\nLet's move on to quotient identities. There are two known quotient identities we usually see in textbook references: \n-   \\\\(\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}\\\\) and \n-   \\\\(\\cot\\theta=\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}\\\\)\nHowever, any of the six functions can be a ratio between others. We can express these ratios using the tool. To find a quotient identity: \n-   Start with the function we want to describe as a ratio – say tangent. \n-   Then, choose two consecutive functions from it. From tangent, it would either be sine-cosine or secant-cosecant.\n-   Say we consider the first set. We can read the quotient identity as \\\\(\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta}\\\\). If we choose the other one, it is \\\\(\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\sec\\theta}{\\csc\\theta}\\\\).\n### Pythagorean Identity\n![Pythagorean identities](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e356be449e5c45197fac69_WTS-1-Mathematics_HexagonMnemonic-4.png)\nFinally, we can move on to the Pythagorean identities. There are only three:\n1.  \\\\(\\sin^2{θ}+cos^2{θ}=1\\\\)\n2.  \\\\(tan^2{θ}+1=sec^2{θ}\\\\)\n3.  \\\\(1+cot^2{θ}=csc^2{θ}\\\\)\nTo read these identities from the figure, consider the illustration again. Say we want to find the first identity \\\\(\\sin^2{θ}+cos^2{θ}=1\\\\):\n1.  We consider an inverted triangle, as shown in the figure.\n2.  From this triangle, read the identity from top-left to top-right to bottom.\n3.  We read the identity as the square of the top-left function plus the square of the top-right function equals the square of the bottom function.\nIn this case, it is: sine squared (top-left) plus cosine squared (top-right) equals one squared (bottom): \\\\(\\sin^2{θ}+cos^2{θ}=1\\\\)\nThis procedure applies to the other two inverted triangles: \\\\(tan^2{θ}+1=sec^2{θ}\\\\) and \\\\(1+cot^2{θ}=csc^2{θ}\\\\)\n## Summary\n> We can use a hexagon trigonometric tool to identify reciprocal, quotient, and Pythagorean identities (See figure)\n> When a line connects two directly opposite vertices, they are reciprocals. \n> When we consider a function and two consecutive ones, we have a quotient identity\n> When we consider one of the three inverted triangles, we can derive a Pythagorean identity.\n",

It's a concept often overlooked but essential if we want a uniform understanding of all structures.\n## Datum References\n![Datum references of a structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5932d43afcd375ae71ae_WTS-Structure_9-1.png)\nThe most common way to establish references is the Cartesian grid reference. When using this system, we generally consider the following:\n-   We place the origin \\\\(\\left(0,0\\right)\\\\), usually at the bottom-left point of the structure. \n-   The x-axis runs horizontally through the origin, while the y-axis runs through the origin perpendicular to the x-axis.\nIn this way, all values are in Quadrant 1 (all are positive).\n## Global and Local References\n![Difference between global and local axes](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e594ed43afce4c8ae7351_WTS-Structure_9-2.png)\nThere are two types of references: global and local. The difference lies in how we see the structure as a whole.\nTo illustrate, let's consider a [rigid plane frame](/tree-posts/what-is-a-frame) \\\\(ABCD\\\\).\n![Example of global and local axes](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e595f8273c2093db99e45_WTS-Structure_9-3.png)\nWhen we analyze a structure globally, we interpret it as a whole. It typically means that the origin is at the bottom-left point of the structure. In this case, it would be at point \\\\(A\\\\).\nFrom origin \\\\(A\\\\), we can properly identify the location of other joints \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(D\\\\) relative to point \\\\(A\\\\). Usually, we use this type to solve for the reaction supports in the classical method (more on [structural analysis](/tree-posts/structural-analysis)).\nWhen we analyze a structure using local references, we break it into its elements and establish the datum per component.\nIn our rigid frame example, let's break it into members \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), and joints \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\). After breaking it into its components, we can create our local reference for each. For example:\n-   In member \\\\(AB\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(A\\\\), and the x-axis goes from \\\\(A\\\\) to \\\\(B\\\\)\n-   In member \\\\(BC\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(B\\\\), and the x-axis goes from \\\\(B\\\\) to \\\\(C\\\\)\n-   In member \\\\(CD\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(C\\\\), and the x-axis goes from \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(D\\\\)\n-   In joint \\\\(A\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(A\\\\), and the y-axis parallel with member \\\\(AB\\\\)\n-   In joint \\\\(B\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(B\\\\), and the x-axis parallel with member \\\\(BC\\\\)\n-   In joint \\\\(C\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(C\\\\), and the x-axis parallel with member \\\\(BC\\\\)\n-   In joint \\\\(D\\\\), we let the origin be at \\\\(D\\\\), and the y-axis parallel with member \\\\(CD\\\\)\nThese references are limited to the components of the structure; hence, they're named \"local.\" These are beneficial when we want to [analyze](/tree-posts/structural-analysis) the forces, stresses, and deflection per member.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Placing a grid reference to identify critical points is necessary when solving structures.\n> The most common way to establish one is the Cartesian grid reference.\n> There are two types: global and local.\n> When we analyze globally, we interpret the structure as a whole.\n> When we analyze locally, we break a structure into its elements and establish the datum per component.\n",

It is assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material).\n![Double overhanging beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64550f56b6962877bf43ba3b_WTS-Structure_23.002-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe beam has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A \\\\(27kN•m (19.91kip•ft)\\\\) clockwise moment.\n-   A varying linear load from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(45kN/m (3.08kip/ft)\\\\).\n-   A uniform load of \\\\(36kN/m (2.47kip/ft)\\\\).\n-   A \\\\(90kN (20.23kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Beam, Determinate Beam_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n![Establishing the references of the beam](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64550f6d2b4974cc36c6893d_WTS-Structure_23.002-2.png)\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the leftmost point of the beam. Consequently, the x-axis will run along the length of the beam with the y-axis perpendicular to it at the origin.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), change in [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads), and differences in the beam's [cross-sectional properties](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section). Starting from \\\\(A\\\\) and going toward the other end, we identify the following points of interest: \n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The \\\\(27kN•m (19.91kip•ft)\\\\) clockwise moment.\n-   \\\\(B(2.0m, 0.0m), B(6.56ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).

The end of the uniform distributed load \\\\(36kN/m (2.47kip/ft)\\\\) **↓** and the hinge support, and\n-   \\\\(E(12.5m, 0.0m), E(41.01ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The \\\\(90kN (20.23kip)\\\\) downward concentrated load.\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor a 2D beam, it is:\n\\\\(D=r-(3+e\\_c)\\\\)\nThis beam example have three reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), and \\\\(R\\_E\\\\), and no internal connections \\\\(e\\_c = 0\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=3-(3+0)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-beam-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h, A\\_v, R\\_E\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the beam is externally stable. In terms of its internal stability, the beam arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Solving the reactions of the beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64550f932b49743d6ac68cc9_WTS-Structure_23.002-3.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(D\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left, and \n-   \\\\(R\\_B\\\\) and \\\\(D\\_v\\\\) are acting upwards.\nThen, applying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\rightarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_B}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(27+\\frac{1}{2}(4.5)(45)(4.5\\times\\frac{2}{3})+36(4.5)(4.5+\\frac{4.5}{2})+90(4.5+4.5+1.5)-D\\_v(4.5+4.5)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_v=263.25kN (59.18kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_B+D\\_v-\\frac{1}{2}(4.5)(45)-36(4.5)-90=0\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_B=90kN (20.23kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components of the structure are: \n\\\\(D\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_v=263.25kN (59.18kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_B=90kN (20.23kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._ \nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn our example, we limit to shear and moment only.\n##### Modeling Shear and Moment Behavior\nWe can use shear and moment equations and graphs to describe the beam's internal behavior.\nCreating these equations and diagrams deserves a separate section. Learn more about how to construct these using these individual posts:\n-   [Shear and Moment Equations (Analytical Approach)](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment)\n-   [Shear and Moment Diagrams (Graphical Approach)](/tree-posts/what-are-load-shear-and-moment-relationships)\nThe following shows our beam's shear and moment equations and diagrams. _You can view the complete solution in these links:_\n-   [Shear and Moment Equations](/tree-posts/how-to-form-shear-and-moment-equations)\n-   [Load and Shear Relationships](/tree-posts/what-are-load-and-shear-relationships)\n-   [Shear and Moment Relationships](/tree-posts/what-are-shear-and-moment-relationships)\n###### Shear\n**SI Equations**\n\\\\(V\\_{AB}=0,\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\leq2\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{BC}=-5x^2+20x+70,\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\leq6.5\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{CD}=-36x+222.75,\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\leq11\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{DE}=90,\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\leq12.5\\\\}\\\\)\n**Diagram**\n‍\n###### Moment\n**SI Equations**\n\\\\(M\\_{AB}=27,\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\leq2\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{BC}=-\\frac{5}{3}x^3+10x^2+70x-139\\frac{2}{3},\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\leq6.5\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{CD}=-18x^2+222.75x-407.25,\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\leq11\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{DE}=90x-1125,\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\leq12.5\\\\}\\\\)\n**Diagram**\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation.

      "Paid Content": "## Converting To Standard Form\nSince the Bernoulli and standard forms of DE are nearly identical, our goal is to make it such. We follow three steps to accomplish this:\n1.  Remove \\\\(y^n\\\\)\n2.  Introduce \\\\(m\\\\)\n3.  Substitute \\\\(y^m\\\\)\n### Remove \\\\(y^n\\\\)\nRecall that the standard form is \\\\(y^\\prime + a(x)y = b(x)\\\\). Bernoulli's \\\\(y^n\\\\) at the right side is the only thing that makes the equation non-linear. So, the first step is to eliminate this. To do so, all we have to do is to divide the whole equation by \\\\(y^n\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y’ + a(x)y = b(x)y^n\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{y^{\\prime}+a(x) y}{y^n}=\\frac{b(x) y^n}{y^n}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y^{-n} y^{\\prime}+a(x) y^{1-n}=b(x)\\\\)\n### Introduce m\nAfter removing \\\\(y^n\\\\), our equation then becomes: \\\\(y^{-n} y^{\\prime}+a(x) y^{1-n}=b(x)\\\\). If we look closely, this form still does not conform to the standard format because of the first term \\\\(y^{-n}y^{\\prime}\\\\) in the left side of the equation.\nFor this reason, we will multiply the equation by a factor \\\\(m\\\\). \n-   \\\\(y^{-n} y^{\\prime}+a(x) y^{1-n}=b(x)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(m y^{-n} y^{\\prime}+m a(x) y^{1-n}=m b(x)\\\\)\nLet’s investigate the first term \\\\(m y^{-n} y^{\\prime}\\\\) together with the power rule:\n\\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(u^m\\right)=m u^{m-1} \\frac{d u}{d x}\\\\)\nThere is a parallelism between these expressions:\n1.  \\\\(y^{-n}=u^{m-1}\\\\)\n2.  \\\\(y^{\\prime} = \\frac{du}{dx}\\\\)\nWith this, we can rewrite the first term as \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^m\\right)\\\\). Consequently, Bernoulli's equation becomes: \n-   \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^m\\right)+m a(x) y^{1-n}=m b(x)\\\\)\nLet's go back and investigate the factor \\\\(m\\\\). What is it specifically?\nGoing back to the first parallelism: \\\\(y^{-n}=u^{m-1}\\\\), we can solve for \\\\(m\\\\):\n-   \\\\(y^{-n}=u^{m-1}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(-n=m-1\\\\)\n-   \\\\(m=1-n\\\\)\nNotice that the \\\\(y\\\\) in the second term in the expression \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^m\\right)+m a(x) y^{1-n}=m b(x)\\\\) equals \\\\(1-n\\\\), we can further simplify it with \\\\(m\\\\); hence, the expression becomes:\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^m\\right)+m a(x) y^{m}=m b(x)\\\\)\n### Substitute \\\\(y^m\\\\)\nAfter arriving at \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^m\\right)+m a(x) y^{m}=m b(x)\\\\), we substitute \\\\(y^m\\\\) with any random variable to arrive at a first-order linear differential equation.\nThe following steps are similar to finding the general solution of a first-order linear DE problem. After solving the DE, we substitute \\\\(y^m\\\\) back to it.\n## Example\nConsider the differential equation: \\\\(y^\\prime + xy = xy^2\\\\). Let's find a general solution for it.\n### Investigate DE\nBefore we proceed, let's investigate the DE if it obeys the form \\\\(y^\\prime + a(x)y = b(x)y^n\\\\). In our example:\n-   \\\\(a(x) = x\\\\) \n-   \\\\(b(x) = x\\\\).\nIn addition, the form follows Bernoulli's format; hence, we need to change the equation into a first-order linear DE and then find a solution.\n### Apply Method\nThe following shows the whole process for solving the general solution of a Bernoulli Equation. There are two parts: (1) the conversion to a standard DE and (2) the solution through first-order linear DE.\nTo convert to its standard form, we remove first \\\\(y^2\\\\) on the right side:\n-   \\\\(y^\\prime + xy = xy^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{y^{\\prime}+x y}{y^2}=\\frac{x y^2}{y^2}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y^{\\prime} y^{-2}+x y^{-1}=x\\\\)\nAfter, we multiply it with \\\\(m\\\\):\n-   \\\\(m=1-n=1-(2)=-1\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y^{\\prime} y^{-2}+x y^{-1}=x\\\\)\n-   \\\\((-1) y^{\\prime} y^{-2}+(-1) x y^{-1}=(-1) x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^{-1}\\right)-x y^{-1}=-x\\\\)\nFinally, we substitute \\\\(y^{-1}\\\\) with a variable - say \\\\(z\\\\):\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}(z)-x z=-x\\\\)\nWe have converted Bernoulli's equation to a first-order differential equation. All that remains is to solve this:\n-   \\\\(a(x)=-x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(b(x)=-x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\mu=e^{\\int a(x) d x}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\mu=e^{\\int-x d x}=e^{\\frac{-x^2}{2}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\int \\mu b(x) d x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(z=1+C e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\\\)\nRemember though to return \\\\(y^-1=z\\\\) after solving it:\n-   \\\\(y^{-1}=1+C e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=\\left(1+C e^{\\frac{x^2}{2}}\\right)^{-1}\\\\)\n## Summary\n> A Bernoulli Equation is a DE of the form \\\\(y^\\prime + a(x)y = b(x)y^n\\\\). It's the non-linear format of the first-order linear differential equation. The expressions \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\), \\\\(y^\\prime\\\\) is the first derivative, \\\\(a(x)\\\\) and \\\\(b(x)\\\\) are functions, and \\\\(y\\\\) is the dependent variable\n> The value \\\\(n\\\\) is the degree of the \\\\(y\\\\) variable. It must NOT be equal to either zero or one. \n> To find the general solution to this DE, we must change this equation to its standard form and then solve it using the integrating factor and the general solution equation.\n> There are three general steps to accomplish this: (1) remove \\\\(y^n\\\\),  (2) introduce \\\\(m\\\\), and (3) substitute \\\\(y^m\\\\).\n> To remove \\\\(y^n\\\\), divide the whole equation by \\\\(y^n\\\\)\n> Multiply the whole expression with \\\\(m=1-n\\\\) afterwards and convert the form into: \\\\(\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(y^m\\right)+m a(x) y^{m}=m b(x)\\\\)\n> Substitute \\\\(y^m\\\\) with a random variable to get the standard form\n> Solve for the standard form using the integrating factor and the general solution equation.\n> Return \\\\(y^m\\\\) back after getting the general solution.\n",

Typically, the engineer would make an initial model based on the architect's plans. It includes, for example, positioning components, giving them properties, and assigning their behavior.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Stage 2: Load Analysis\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453a1847e3f7c25ac1a82e5_WTS-Structure_2-2.png)\nNext, [one must identify all possible loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads) the created model in the previous step may experience during its lifetime. These represent the forces that the building will carry. Usually, we find these using structural codes and reliable resources. Examples include the following:\n-   **Dead Loads.** These are the structure's self-weight and the objects it carries.\n-   **Live Loads.** People, movable furniture, or vehicles.\n-   **Lateral Loads.** Wind from hurricanes or earthquakes.\n## Stage 3: Structural Analysis\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453a18cef26904bee312df2_WTS-Structure_2-3.png)\nAfter identifying loads comes [analysis](/tree-posts/structural-analysis). The main goal of this step is to investigate the structure's behavior. Later on, we'll see how this stage answers questions about the structure's stability, reactions, stresses, and deflection under the loads set in Stage 2.\n## Stage 4: Design\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453a192ab2196c4084e2fd6_WTS-Structure_2-4.png)\nAfter studying the structure's behavior in the previous step, engineers can design the building parts. Through this process, we finally make a safe and usable structure. It involves a lot of things, such as:\n-   Selecting the suitable shape for members\n-   Dimensioning the different parts of the building\n-   Drawing and detailing all information\nThis stage answers questions such as the following: what size do we need for the members? How many fasteners do we need to place? How should we connect the column to the base? What strength of steel and concrete must we use?\nPart of this stage is also to detail all structural parts. At the end of this stage, we'll have a sound drawing or model that the contractor will use to build the structure.\n## The Procedure as a Whole\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453a19cbe61b5ab5041cdd6_WTS-Structure_2-5.png)\nAll stages are connected - it is a logical step-by-step process from Stage 1 to Stage 4; however, it may be more than a one-way process. Engineers may go back and forth among stages to address their findings. For instance, let's say we are analyzing a tall building and find out that the building sways too much due to the wind. To minimize this effect, they can decide whether to:\n-   Continue to design sections that would resist the load (Stage 4), or \n-   Return and modify the model by adding more bracings (Stage 1).\nIn addition, engineers may repeat the whole process after successfully creating a good model. Let's say we have made a safe and usable structure; however, after running a cost check, it is way above the owner's budget. Engineers may redo the whole process again until they have a cost-friendly solution.\nIf we summarize the procedure's goal, it should produce a [safe and functional structure](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structure).\n## Summary\nWe analyze and design structures using a pre-defined process.\n> One can break it down into several stages: (1) modeling, (2) load analysis, (3) structural analysis, and (4) design.\n> Modeling is the stage when we create the structure's skeleton.\n> Load analysis is the stage in which we identify all possible loads or forces the structure may experience during its lifetime.\n> Structural analysis is studying the behavior of the structure under the given loads.\n> Design is the process of making a structure safe and usable. It includes detailing and documentation of the plan.\n> All stages are connected. In summary, the whole process should produce a safe and functional structure.\n",

To freshen our minds, say you have a photo of a mountain and a picture of a sun. If you put the sun's image on top of the other picture, you'll get a new photo combining the mountain and the sun. What does this have to do with solving internal bar forces? \nImagine your complex truss as the combined photo of the mountain and sun in our analogy. Remember that the combined object is a composition of multiple smaller objects. Similarly, we can imagine a complex truss as simple trusses combined. \nWhat we are going to do with the complex truss is to break it down into structures that we can solve. Afterward, we solve these individual structures like [simple trusses](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-trusses), and we will combine their solutions to compute the internal bar forces of the complex truss. This powerful idea in classical analysis is called superposition.\nNow that we got a general idea, how should we break down the complex truss?\n",
      "Paid Content": "## General Outline\nFor this method, we will break down the complex truss into two simple structures: a simple truss and a proxy truss. When we add these two structures together, you'll get the bar forces for each complex truss.\nThe outline below is best understood using this example.\n### Convert to a Simple Truss\n![Convert complex truss to simple](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cff14fe565d9ac782271_WTS-Structure_21.09-1.png)\nThe first step is to convert our complex truss into a simple one by removing any member; however, in doing so, we made the truss [unstable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-truss-stability). To reverse that effect, we add another member. There is no rule on what member to remove or add. There is also no rule about what should be the two joints of our new substitute member. Our goal here is to make our truss simple.\nWe load this simple truss with the supports and loads like that of our original complex truss. The result is a new structure with the same reactions and loads \\\\(S\\_p\\\\), serving as an element for the superposition process.\nLike any other simple truss, the next step is to thoroughly analyze the reactions and bar forces of this simple truss using the [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) or [sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections).\nAt the end of the analysis, you will have each member's axial forces, including the substitute member.\n### Create Proxy Truss\n![Create a similar proxy truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cff6545aff85d9ebadd1_WTS-Structure_21.09-2.png)\nThe next step is to create a proxy truss for the superposition process \\\\(S\\_x\\\\). Remember that we could not solve for the missing member in the simple truss because we removed it; hence, to counteract that effect, we must create the same simple truss as \\\\(S\\_p\\\\) and represent the missing force with a tensile force \\\\(x\\\\).\nOur goal here is to represent all bar forces in terms of this variable \\\\(x\\\\) using either method of joints or section.\n### Apply Superposition\n![Apply superposition to simple and proxy truss to solve for complex truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cffb4fe565ba8a7822a3_WTS-Structure_21.09-3.png)\nAt this point, you have completely solved the bar forces of both structures \\\\(S\\_p\\\\) and \\\\(S\\_x\\\\); hence, we are ready to apply the idea of superposition. \nRemember that we are solving for the bar forces of the complex truss \\\\(S\\_T\\\\). Equation-wise, it is:\n\\\\(S\\_T=S\\_p+S\\_x\\\\)\nWe first apply superposition to solve for \\\\(x\\\\). With it, you can solve the bar forces of the complex truss. To find for \\\\(x\\\\), let's take an interest in the substitute member at \\\\(S\\_p\\\\).\nWe know that it does not exist in our truss example; hence, \\\\(S\\_T\\\\) for this substitute member must be zero:\n\\\\(0=S\\_p+S\\_x(x)\\\\)\nSolving for \\\\(x\\\\) should be possible using the equation above. When you solve for it, you already got the axial force of the original member you removed. With \\\\(x\\\\) cracked, you can complete your analysis by performing superposition to all members.\n## Tips\n-   We should use this method for complex trusses only. We can't use it for [simple or compound trusses](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-trusses); we cannot further break them into simpler ones. If you do so, you're changing the truss itself. For example, suppose you removed a member of a simple [Warren truss](/tree-posts/what-are-common-truss-types) and replaced it with another substitute member to create a simpler truss. In that case, you're converting it into a compound truss which is a different structure than the original. As a consequence, superposition would give the wrong result.\n-   After applying this method, you can check your answers by using the method of joints or sections in the complex truss. In the end, it must comply with the equilibrium principle.\n## Summarise Your Results\nAfter analysis, it is always a good idea to summarise your results using a table.\n## Application\n-   Let's illustrate how to use the method of bar conversions in a [complex truss example](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-bar-conversions).\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Method of Bar Conversions is a procedure for solving the internal bar forces of complex trusses.\n> We break the complex truss into structures that we can solve. Afterward, we solve these individual structures like simple trusses, and we will combine their solutions to compute the internal bar forces of the complex truss.\n> We first break it into a simple truss by removing one member of the complex truss and replacing it with another. Next, we load this new structure with the original loads and supports. Then, we solve for the bar forces of this structure.\n> We create a proxy truss similar to the simple truss. We represent the missing bar force with a variable and express every member in terms of said variable.\n> We apply the principle of superposition for both the simple and proxy truss. The result would be the internal bar forces of the complex truss.\n",

This post explains the theory behind it. At the end of this post, we'll be able to find the volume of an object with a constant cross-section, no matter how complicated it may be.\n## Approximation\n![Volume of a solid by approximation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e358e5dc75826a9c0a59ea_WTS-1-Mathematics_CrossSection-1.png)\nLet's say you're finding the volume \\\\(V\\\\) of the solid figure shown. The object consists of a uniform cross-section throughout its whole length. We can find \\\\(V\\\\) using solid geometry if it is an elementary geometric figure. For unusual solids, the best we can do is approximate them. \nWe must divide the solid into multiple parts to estimate the total volume. To do that, imagine the solid as a series of plane sections stacked on each other.\nA similar illustration would be a paper ream. That one rectangular ream object consists of multiple sheets of paper. That is how we view the solid - layers making up the 3D object.\nAnother critical thing to note is that the plane sections that make up the solid must be similar. In our ream example, the cross sections must be rectangular only.\nFrom this, we begin the process of approximating by:\n1.  First, divide the 3D object into multiple regular solids. It could be cubes, prisms, cylinders, or any other figure.\n2.  Then, we solve the volume \\\\(V\\\\) of each divided solid. From Cavalieri's theorem, \\\\(V=Ah\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is the uniform cross-sectional area and \\\\(h\\\\) is the length of the solid\n3.  Finally, we add all individual \\\\(V\\\\) to get the total approximate volume.\nSince this is an approximation, how can we have a more accurate answer? We increase the number of divisions \\\\(n\\\\). \n-   When we increase the number of solid divisions, the more closely it would lead to the actual value. \n-   As the number of solids increases, the smaller its volume \\\\(dV\\\\) and height \\\\(h\\\\) become.\n",

Building from this, we can solve the precise volume. We will only need to modify two things in the approximate solution: \n-   We need to set up a solid division that is so small we can express its volume as the differential \\\\(dV\\\\)\n-   We need an operation that will sum up all of these tiny divisions\nWe can combine all \\\\(dV\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the volume \\\\(V\\_T\\\\) with constant cross-section is:\n\\\\(V\\_T=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dV}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(V\\_T\\\\) is the total volume\n-   \\\\(dV\\\\) is the differential volume of the division.\n-   \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value)\n-   \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\nThis equation is the general expression we use to solve the volume of a 3D object.

We need to express it in terms of the differential variable. The area function will depend on the orientation of the solid if it is along the x, y, or z-axis.\n-   The differential thickness \\\\(dh\\\\) is the distance between two points; however, because it is so minuscule, we represent it with a position variable \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(y\\\\), or \\\\(z\\\\).

We have to ensure that the beam we're examining is indeed stable.

There is a proper arrangement of the truss's supports, and\n2.  The number of supports must be greater or equal to the number of [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations.\nIn the case of beams, we have to consider the possibility of structures with [internal devices](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) such as hinges and links.

These conditions must be satisfied if a beam is to be externally stable.\n## Internal Stability\nInternal stability deals with the proper arrangement of a structure's components. \nFor beams, internal instability is most likely to occur when we introduce internal devices such as hinges or links. \nTo demonstrate, consider the structure below.\n![Collapse mechanism of a pin-connected beam](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64550ee13a388c4c6954d3f2_WTS-Structure_23.001-1.png)\nLet's first examine its external stability:\n-   There is a proper arrangement of supports.\n-   The number of unknown components exceeds the number of known conditions with internal devices (3=3).\nBased on this, the beam is externally stable.\nLet's say we apply a concentrated load on the internal pin. As a result, it will deform, as shown below.\nIf we release this load, the beam should return to its original position (provided the beam is elastic); however, because of the internal hinge, it may not return. When this happens, we say that the beam has _collapsed_ and is unstable.\nDespite this being an externally stable beam, it is still structurally unstable. A civil structure that behaves the same way as our example above cannot serve its function.\n## Summary\n> A beam is said to be stable if it is both externally and internally stable.\n> External stability happens when these two criteria are satisfied: (1) supports are correctly arranged and (2) \\\\(r{\\geq}3+{e\\_c}\\\\) or \\\\(r{\\geq}6+{e\\_c}\\\\) is satisfied.\n> Internal stability happens when there is a proper arrangement of the components making up the beam.\n",

      "Free Content": "In Strength of Materials, let's recall that objects deform differently depending on the stress they may experience. For example, when we apply a pulling force to a steel rod by hand, it will not elongate significantly. However, when we use heavy machinery when applying a pulling force, it may reach a point where one can see a change in shape.\nThe same goes for [structures](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structure). Depending on how big or small the force is, the structure's materials may behave linearly or nonlinearly.\nIn analysis, it's essential to differentiate the two.\n## Linear and Nonlinear Behavior\nTo fully understand the difference between linear and nonlinear analysis, we need to recall what these terms mean. To begin, let's view a typical stress-strain curve.\nOne key trend from this curve was the linear relationship between stress and strain, as seen from its origin to its yield point. During this stage, we say that the material obeys Hooke's Law. \nIn this stage, it can return to its original position when we remove the loads. In addition, the deformations of the object are relatively small. Other references would term this behavior as elastic.\nAs we apply larger loads on the object, we will eventually reach a point wherein it will pass the linear stage. At this phase, the material would be inelastic. The thing will not return to its original shape if we remove the loads. Meaning it will disobey Hooke's Law.\n## Linear and Nonlinear Analysis\n![Difference between linear and nonlinear analysis](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cb113f44a79fdc6657f5_WTS-Structure_18.5-1.png)\nNow that we have explained linear and nonlinear behavior - let's go back to structures and analysis. \nAs a general rule, when a structure observes an elastic behavior, it is said to be linear; however, if it is inelastic, it is a nonlinear structure. \nIn some unique cases, certain buildings may still be in the linear stage, but it has deformed significantly. Such structures are also nonlinear.\nWhen we classify structures as linear or nonlinear, what does it mean for analysis? To answer that, it has something to do with their properties. A linear structure would have constant properties throughout time. When these become nonlinear, specific properties change over time. Engineers must factor in these changes because these may govern the design.\nExamples of nonlinear analyses include plastic and buckling analysis.\n## Summary\n> When structures behave within the elastic range and have small deformations after all loads are applied, they are said to be linear.\n> When structures fall outside the elastic range, or there are huge deformations despite being in this stage, it is said to be a nonlinear structure.\n",

There are many strategies to create it; however, no matter what approach we use, we need to know two things: (1) the shear value and (2) its slope _at each critical point of the beam per point and segment_.\nTypically, the way we solve it is to analyze each part successively - from the first point to its adjacent segment to the next end and so on. Each component has different objectives we need to accomplish, which we will see later on.\nLet's see this process in action:\n#### Point A\n![Point A](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455152d9f7d639a549e2c3f_WTS-Structure_23.006-1.png)\nWe first start by examining point \\\\(A\\\\) by itself. Here, we are looking at the value of shear at the said point. Another thing we need to see here is to check if the shear will be affected by discontinuities (concentrated loads).\nIn this example, the external load acting on it is a moment; hence, it doesn't affect the shear. In this case, the shear is zero:\n\\\\(V\\_A=0\\\\)\n#### Segment AB\n![Segment AB](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455153be8f9ba646aa669e1_WTS-Structure_23.006-2.png)\nAfter examining point \\\\(A\\\\) and its shear, we move on to the adjacent segment \\\\(AB\\\\). When analyzing segments, we need to find two things: (1) the shear and (2) its slope at its endpoints \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\).\n##### Endpoint A\n###### Shear Value\nFrom examining point \\\\(A\\\\), we saw that \\\\(V\\_A=0\\\\). In this segment, it is still equal to zero!\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the shear slope equation:\n\\\\(w\\_A=\\frac{dV}{dx}=V\\_{A}'\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{A}'=0\\\\)\nThere is no concentrated (or varying load) at point \\\\(A\\\\); hence, we have a zero slope. It means that the tangent line plot must be a horizontal line.\n##### Endpoint B\n###### Shear Value\nNext, we consider the shear at point \\\\(B\\\\). To solve it, we will use the change in shear expression to find the value:\n\\\\(V\\_B-V\\_A=\\Delta{V\\_{BA}}=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}w\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_B-0=\\int\\_{0}^{2}0\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_B=0\\\\)\nThere is no \\\\(w\\\\) loads in segment \\\\(AB\\\\); that's why \\\\(V\\_B\\\\) is still zero.\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the shear slope equation:\n\\\\(w\\_B=\\frac{dV}{dx}=V\\_{B}'\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{B}'=0\\\\)\nA zero slope will mean the tangent line plot must be a horizontal line.\n#### Point B\n![Point B](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455154a7a1536cd47f1a9b9_WTS-Structure_23.006-3.png)\nNext, we examine point \\\\(B\\\\) by itself.

Again, we need to find two things: (1) the shear and (2) its slope at its endpoints \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\).\n##### Endpoint B\n###### Shear Value\nFrom examining point \\\\(B\\\\), we saw that \\\\(V\\_B\\\\) became \\\\(90kN\\\\).

It is at this point wherein the moment is at its maximum.\nThere are many ways to find this point. We can see the solution in this separate [post](/tree-posts/what-is-the-point-of-zero-shear). At the end of the article, the location of zero shear from the origin is at:\n\\\\(x=6.2426\\\\)\n#### Point C\n![Point C](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455156fe8f9baec33a66acf_WTS-Structure_23.006-5.png)\nNext, we examine point \\\\(C\\\\) by itself.

Likewise, this segment's shear \\\\(V\\_D\\\\) is \\\\(90kN\\\\).\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the shear slope equation:\n\\\\(w\\_D=\\frac{dV}{dx}=V\\_{D}'\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{D}'=0\\\\)\nA zero slope will mean the tangent line plot must be a horizontal line.\n##### Endpoint E\n###### Shear Value\nNext, we consider the shear at point \\\\(E\\\\). To solve it, we will use the change in shear expression to find the value:\n\\\\(V\\_E-V\\_D=\\Delta{V\\_{ED}}=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}w\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_E-90=\\int\\_{11}^{12.5}0\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_E=90kN\\\\)\nThere is no \\\\(w\\\\) loads in segment \\\\(DE\\\\); that's why \\\\(V\\_E\\\\) is still zero.\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope at said point, we use the shear slope equation:\n\\\\(w\\_E=\\frac{dV}{dx}=V\\_{E}'\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{E}'=0\\\\)\nA zero slope will mean the tangent line plot must be a horizontal line.\n#### Point E\n![Point E](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645515b73d3dd8c9d5901693_WTS-Structure_23.006-9.png)\nFinally, we examine point \\\\(E\\\\) by itself. From the previous segment, the shear \\\\(V\\_{E\\_1}\\\\) is \\\\(90kN\\\\); however, point \\\\(E\\\\) is the location of a concentrated load with a value of \\\\(-90kN\\\\). There is a discontinuity at this point. The shear at \\\\(E\\\\) becomes:\n\\\\(V\\_{E\\_2}=90+(-90)\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{E\\_2}=0kN\\\\)\nWe have reached the end of the beam. One way to check if our solution is correct is to evaluate if the shear at the end is zero (to comply with equilibrium)\n## Drawing the Shear Diagram\nNow that we know the shear value and slope for each critical point per point and segment, we can finally construct the shear diagram per segment.\nThe shear values and slopes per segment are the following: \n### Segment AB\n\\\\(V\\_A=0\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{A}'=0\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_B=0\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{B}'=0\\\\)\n### Segment BC\n\\\\(V\\_B=90kN\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{B}'=0\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_C=-11.25kN\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{C}'=-45\\\\)\n### Segment CD\n\\\\(V\\_C=-11.25kN\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{C}'=-36\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_D=-173.25kN\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{D}'=-36\\\\)\n### Segment DE\n\\\\(V\\_D=90kN\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{D}'=0\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_E=90kN\\\\), \\\\(V\\_{E}'=0\\\\)\nThese values are the information we need to draw the shear diagram. Plotting the shear values on a graph and drawing a tangent line along these points, we have the following chart:\n‍\nHow do we know if our diagram is correct? The shear must close back to zero when we analyze the final point. In this case, it closed \\\\(V\\_E=0kN\\\\) when we investigated point \\\\(E\\\\).\n",

      "Free Content": "Moment By Parts is another approach to express the internal bending moment of a structure. It is an alternative way of drawing [moment diagrams](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment).\nThis procedure makes our analysis more straightforward. It allows us to compute the area of the moment graph quickly rather than using concepts in [integral calculus](/tree-posts/integral-calculus). In addition, we may need to find the centroid of the moment diagram in specific topics, which may be difficult. Moment By Parts helps us simplify this concern.\n## Key Idea: Break The Structure into Cantilever Parts, Then Superimpose\nThis procedure relies on two concepts: (1) [cantilever beam patterns](/tree-posts/how-to-get-the-area-and-centroid-of-cantilever-moment-diagrams-easily) and (2) [superposition](/tree-posts/what-is-superposition).\nThe former depends on a solid understanding of the cantilever beam, which we can discover more about in this [link](/tree-posts/analyzing-the-cantilever-beam). What's important to understand is that there is a fascinating pattern with the beam's moment diagram.\nThe latter deals with an essential concept in classical analysis. Superposition tells us that a beam can be a sum of similar independent beams.\n## General Outline\nThe following is a general outline of how to use moment by parts:\n### Strategically Cut the Beam Into Parts\n![Strategically cut the beam into parts](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64560d7c09c5e10b760ad236_WTS-Structure_23.02-1.png)\nThe first step when using the moment diagram by parts is to place a cut section in the beam. When you cut the beam at any point, you'll divide it into the left and right sections. Not only that, [you'll reveal its internal shear and moment](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment) at the cut point.\nWith the beam divided, let's shift our perspective of the beam. Consider one division of the beam. If you look closely at this part, it is analogous to a cantilever beam. The unknown shear and moment are like the reactions of the cantilever's fixed-end support. The loads, including its reaction loads, are like the cantilever's external forces. The same is true if you consider the other division.\nAnother way of thinking about what we did is that we divided the beam into two cantilever beams.\n",

One way to accomplish this is by mimicking the beam patterns.\nFor example, if we have one concentrated load and a uniform load on one division, we would create two cantilever beams. The first would have the first load, and the other with the uniform load.\nIf we have a loading condition we cannot mimic, we may create an extra cantilever to negate it. \nThe main goal of these cantilevers is to create simplified models of the beam's moment. We want it easy to compute the moment diagram's area and centroid.\n### Superimpose Each Part\n![Superimpose each moment diagram](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64560d98bb983c726a748957_WTS-Structure_23.02-3.png)\nAfter drawing the moment diagrams for each cantilever part, we combine these graphs. The resulting graph is the \"moment diagram by parts.\" With this diagram, we can quickly compute the area and centroids of each graph. It is a handy skill, especially with discussions such as the [area-moment method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-area-moment-method).\n## Tips\n-   We can choose any point along the beam to place a section, but we should strategically place the plane to mimic most loading condition patterns.\n-   If we add each moment value in the parts diagram, we will get the moment as if we modeled the beam using moment equations.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Moment By Parts is another approach to express the internal bending moment of a structure.\n> It allows us to compute the area and centroid of the moment graph quickly.\n> This procedure relies on two concepts: (1) cantilever beam patterns and (2) superposition.\n> The first step when using the moment diagram by parts is to place a cut section in the beam into two cantilevers.\n> After cutting the beam into two cantilevers, we further broke it down into multiple cantilevers so it would be easy to model its moment diagram.\n> After drawing the moment diagrams for each cantilever part, we combine these graphs.

Say we have a rectangular prism like a piece of French Fry, and we've applied a pulling force at its ends. Let's put an exploratory section in the middle and orient it in different ways:\n-   If the plane is perpendicular to the resultant pulling force, only the axial force resists the pull.\n-   If the plane is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the resultant pulling force, axial and shear forces provide resistance to the pull.\n-   If the plane is parallel to the resultant pulling force, only the shear force resists the pull.\nYou can see that the type of internal force changes depending on the plane's orientation.\n## How Should We Orient the Section?\nHow should we place the section? That depends on what we're investigating.\nMost of the time, we need to find out the maximum internal force developed on the object.

The smaller this variable, the better the approximation is.\n-   Consider a single point along the solution curve \\\\((x\\_0, y\\_0)\\\\).

Later, we will be able to verify if the directions are correct.\n### Derive Key Relationships\n![Key relationships among deflection and deviation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a0ead7bce4108418ba69_WTS-Structure_29.3-4-3.png)\nNext, we derive relationships for all deflection components based on our sketch. We can create geometric relationships among the different elements and deviations.\nLet's draw a reference tangent at one of the supports. In this case, the roller at \\\\(B\\\\). \nUsing the exact figure, we identify all key points \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\) and their corresponding position in the deflected shape \\\\(A^{\\prime}\\\\), \\\\(B^{\\prime}\\\\), \\\\(C^{\\prime}\\\\), \\\\(D^{\\prime}\\\\), \\\\(E^{\\prime} \\\\), as well on the reference tangent \\\\(A^{\\prime \\prime}, B^{\\prime \\prime}, C^{\\prime \\prime}, D^{\\prime \\prime}, E^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\). Next, identify similar triangles \\\\(BAA^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(BCC^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(BDD^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), and \\\\(BEE ^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\). We draw and label all deviations, translations \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), and rotations \\\\(\\theta\\\\) of said triangles.\n#### Translation\nFrom our figure, we can derive these relationships:\nEquation 1-1: \\\\(\\frac{A A^{\\prime \\prime}}{2}=\\frac{C C^{\\prime \\prime}}{4.5}=\\frac{D D^{\\prime \\prime}}{9}=\\frac{E E^{\\prime \\prime}}{10.5}\\\\)\nInvestigating further, distances \\\\(AA^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(CC^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(DD^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) and \\\\(EE^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) can be expressed as:\nEquation 1-2: \\\\(A A^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(+\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\right)-\\left(+t\\_{A / B}\\right)\\\\)\nEquation 1-3: \\\\(C C^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(-\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{C / B}\\right)\\\\)\nEquation 1-4: \\\\(D D^{\\prime \\prime}=+t\\_{D / B}\\\\)\nEquation 1-5: \\\\(E E^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(-\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{E / B}\\right)\\\\)\nNotice that we have expressed it into their respective deviations and deflections (with the appropriate sign convention).\n#### Rotation\nSimilarly, we can create a relationship for the assumed clockwise rotation \\\\(\\theta\\_{B}\\\\) by taking the ratio of a triangle's opposite and adjacent sides. Let's use triangle \\\\(BDD^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) to form such a relationship:\nEquation 2-1: \\\\(-\\theta\\_B=-\\frac{D D^{\\prime \\prime}}{9}=-\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}\\\\)\nWe can derive relationships for rotation at other critical points based on our sketch; however, we will derive only one relation to show the use of the [first theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-change-in-slope-in-the-area-moment-method) later.\n### Solve for Deviations\nAfter formulating relationships among deviations and deflections, it's time to solve for deviations \\\\(t\\\\) of Equations 1-2 to 1-5.\nWe apply the [second theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-tangential-deviation) to solve for tangential deviations among \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\). For this approach, we will integrate math \\\\(M/EI\\\\) expressions.\nUsing the \\\\(M/EI\\\\) diagram we set up earlier, let's compute for \\\\(t\\_{A/B}\\\\), \\\\(t\\_{C/B}\\\\), \\\\(t\\_{D/B}\\\\), and \\\\(t\\_{E/B}\\\\):\n\\\\(t\\_{A / B}=\\int\\_0^2 \\frac{1}{E I}(27 x) d x=\\frac{54}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{C / B}=\\int\\_2^{6.5} \\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right)(6.5-x) d x=\\frac{1486.48}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{D / B}=\\int\\_2^{6.5} \\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right)(11-x) d x+\\int\\_{6.5}^{11} \\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-18 x^2+\\frac{891}{4} x-\\frac{1629}{4}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\((11-x) d x=\\frac{474579}{64 E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{E / B}=\\int\\_2^{6.5} \\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right)(12.5-x) d x+\\int\\_{6.5}^{11} \\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-18 x^2+\\frac{891}{4} x-\\frac{1629}{4}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\((12.5-x) d x+\\int\\_{11}^{12.5} \\frac{1}{E I}(90 x-1125)(12.5-x) d x=\\frac{9506.74}{E I}\\\\)\nWith deviations solved, it's important to check the sign convention. In this case, all deviations are positive. Recall that if a deviation is positive, its corresponding point in the deflected shape is above the reference tangent. Looking back at our figure, the directional sense of our deviations matches our drawing.\nWe may have an incorrect sketch if our answers contradict our drawing. If so, we may need to redraw and reformulate relationships.\n### Solve for Deflection Components\nWe can now compute for the deflection components with deviations solved using our earlier derived relationships.\n#### Translation\nUsing Equations 1–1 to 1–5, let's solve for \\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\\\), \\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\\\), and \\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\\\):\n\\\\(\\frac{\\left(+\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\right)-\\left(+t\\_{A / B}\\right)}{2}=\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}=\\frac{2}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}+\\frac{54}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}=\\frac{1701.84}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{\\left(-\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{C / B}\\right)}{4.5}=\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}=-\\left(\\frac{4.5}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}-\\frac{1486.48}{E I}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}=-\\frac{2221.18}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}=\\frac{\\left(-\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{E / B}\\right)}{10.5}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=-\\left(\\frac{10.5}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}-\\frac{9506.74}{E I}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=\\frac{855.62}{E I}\\\\)\nWith translations solved, the only thing we need to do is to verify the position of these deflections through their signs. For \\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\\\) and \\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\\\), our answers are positive, which means that translation is upwards at these points. On the other hand, \\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\\\) is negative, which means point \\\\(C\\\\) deflected downwards.\nInitially, we assumed that the translation at E is downward; however, our computations show that the point deflected upwards. The solution will correct itself if we have defined the relationships properly (Equation 1-1 to 1-5).\n#### Rotation\nLet us proceed with the remaining deflection components: the rotations at \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\).\nSince we know the value of \\\\(t\\_{D/B}\\\\), we can use Equation 2-1 to solve for the slope at \\\\(B\\\\).\n\\\\(-\\theta\\_B=-\\frac{474579}{9 \\times 64 E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(-\\theta\\_B=-\\frac{823.92}{E I}\\\\)\nRemember that we have assumed the rotation at \\\\(B\\\\) to be negative; however, since we have solved the translations at all critical points, we can verify the directional sense of the rotation. We can see in the figure that the slope at \\\\(B\\\\) is indeed clockwise.\nVerifying the sign convention is important because we will use the [first theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-change-in-slope-in-the-area-moment-method) of the area moment method to solve for the remaining rotation components \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_C\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_D\\\\), and \\\\(\\theta\\_E\\\\); From \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\), we can choose any other point to solve for the missing rotations. For example, to find the slope at \\\\(A\\\\):\n\\\\(\\theta\\_B-\\theta\\_A=\\frac{1}{E I} \\int\\_0^2 27 d x\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_A=-\\frac{823.92}{E I}-\\frac{54}{E I}=-\\frac{877.9}{E I}\\\\)\nNext, we solve for the rotation at \\\\(C\\\\). You can choose any other solved rotation like \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\) as your reference; however, let's still use \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) as our basis.\n\\\\(\\theta\\_C-\\theta\\_B=\\frac{1}{E I} \\int\\_2^{6.5}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right) d x\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_C=\\frac{861.89}{E I}-\\frac{823.92}{E I}=\\frac{37.8}{E I}\\\\)\nWe apply the same principle to solve for rotations \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\) using \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) as our other rotation component:\n\\\\(\\theta\\_D-\\theta\\_B=\\frac{1}{E I} \\int\\_2^{6.5}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right) d x+\\int\\_{6.5}^{11}\\left(-18 x^2+\\frac{891}{4} x-\\frac{1629}{4}\\right) d x\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_D=\\frac{1461.80}{E I}-\\frac{823.92}{E I}=\\frac{637.9}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_E-\\theta\\_B=\\frac{1}{E I} \\int\\_2^{6.5}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right) d x+\\int\\_{6.5}^{11}\\left(-18 x^2+\\frac{891}{4} x-\\frac{1629}{4}\\right) d x\\\\)\n\\\\(+\\int\\_{11}^{12.5}(90 x-1125) d x\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_E=\\frac{1360.55}{E I}-\\frac{823.92}{E I}=\\frac{536.6}{E I}\\\\)\nWith angular deflections solved, verifying these components' directions is the only thing left to do. \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\) and \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) are negative, which means the rotation is clockwise, while \\\\(\\theta\\_C\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_D\\\\), and \\\\(\\theta\\_E\\\\) are positive indicating a counterclockwise rotation. We make sure these are correct by comparing them to our sketch.\n### Deflection Matrix\n‍\nAt this point, we have solved all 15 deflection components. It is best to summarise all our results using a deflection matrix. The sign convention described in the table is as follows:\n-   A positive-sense rotation means that the point rotated counterclockwise from the local longitudinal axis (+x-axis), while negative means the opposite.\n-   A positive-sense translation means the point deflected upward from the local longitudinal axis (+x-axis), while negative means the opposite.\n",

This post is the second in the series.**\n**For the first part, we can visit this** **[link](/tree-posts/what-are-load-and-shear-relationships).**\n## Main Solution\nThe following section shows how to relate load, shear, and moment. It makes it possible to create shear and moment diagrams without formulating equations:\nFor this post, we'll see how to relate shear and moment:\n### Set-Up References\n![Beam example references](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64550f6d2b4974cc36c6893d_WTS-Structure_23.002-2.png)\nBefore relating load, shear, and moment, we must set up [references](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references).

      "Paid Content": "### Draw the Shear Diagram\nTo draw the moment diagram, we must have its shear diagram. We have covered how to obtain it in the [last part](/tree-posts/what-are-load-and-shear-relationships).\n### Moment Diagram (Shear-Moment)\nLet's draw the moment diagram based on the beam's shear. There are many strategies to create it; however, no matter what approach we use, we need to know two things: (1) the moment value and (2) its slope _at each critical beam point per point and segment_.\nTypically, the way we solve it is to analyze each part successively - from the first point to its adjacent segment to the next end and so on. Each component has different objectives we need to accomplish, which we will see later.\nLet's see this process in action:\n#### Point A\n![Point A](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455174305e2957ce39bcaf7_WTS-Structure_23.007-1.png)\nWe first start by examining point \\\\(A\\\\) by itself. Here, we are looking at the value of the moment at the said point. Another thing we need to see here is to check if the shear will be affected by discontinuities (moments).\nIn this example, the external load acting on it is a 27kN•m clockwise (+) moment; hence, discontinuity exists. In this case, the moment becomes:\n\\\\(M\\_{A\\_2}=M\\_{A\\_1}+27\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{A\\_2}=0+27\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{A\\_2}=27kN•m\\\\)\nWhen we analyze the next segment after, we use \\\\(M\\_{A\\_2}=27kN•m\\\\) instead of \\\\(M\\_{A\\_1}=0\\\\).\n#### Segment AB\n![Segment AB](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455174ce8f9ba5ff8a683e1_WTS-Structure_23.007-2.png)\nAfter examining point \\\\(A\\\\) and its moment, we move on to the adjacent segment \\\\(AB\\\\). When analyzing segments, we need to find two things: (1) the moment and (2) its slope at its endpoints \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\).\n##### Endpoint A\n###### Moment Value\nFrom examining point \\\\(A\\\\), we saw that \\\\(M\\_A=27kN•m\\\\). In this segment, it is still equal to \\\\(27kN•m\\\\)\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_A=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{A'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{A}'=0\\\\)\nThe shear at point \\\\(A\\\\) is zero; hence, we have a zero slope. It means that the tangent line plot must be a horizontal line.\n##### Endpoint B\n###### Moment Value\nNext, we consider the moment at point \\\\(B\\\\). To solve it, we will use the change in moment expression to find the value:\n\\\\(M\\_B-M\\_A=\\Delta{M}=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}V\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_B-27=\\int\\_{0}^{2}0\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_B=27kN•m\\\\)\nThere is no shear in segment \\\\(AB\\\\), so \\\\(M\\_B\\\\) is still zero.\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_B=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{B'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{B}'=0\\\\)\nA zero slope means the tangent line plot must be horizontal.\n#### Point B\n![Point B](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455175b0aa34d83f8b9fef7_WTS-Structure_23.007-3.png)\nNext, we examine point \\\\(B\\\\) by itself. From the previous segment, the moment \\\\(M\\_{B\\_1}\\\\) is \\\\(27kN•m\\\\); Since there is no discontinuity at this point, the moment at \\\\(B\\\\) is still \\\\(27kN•m\\\\).\n#### Segment BC\n![Segment BC](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455176db6962800f54521cb_WTS-Structure_23.007-4.png)\nAfter examining point \\\\(B\\\\) and its moment, we move on to the adjacent segment \\\\(BC\\\\). Again, we need to find two things: (1) the moment and (2) its slope at its endpoints \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\).\n##### Endpoint B\n###### Moment Value\nFrom examining point \\\\(B\\\\), we saw that \\\\(M\\_B\\\\) is \\\\(27kN•m\\\\). Likewise, this segment's moment \\\\(M\\_B\\\\) is \\\\(27kN•m\\\\).\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_B=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{B'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{B}'=90\\\\)\nA positive slope means the tangent line plot must go upward (bottom-left to top-right).\n##### Point of Maximum Moment\n###### Moment Value\nIn addition to finding the moment at endpoints, we need to compute the moment at the location of [zero shear](/tree-posts/what-is-the-point-of-zero-shear) \\\\(B'\\\\). From our previous discussion, this point is at \\\\(x=6.24\\\\) from the origin. It is at this point where the maximum moment occurs. To solve it, we still use the change in moment expression to find the value:\n\\\\(M\\_{B'}-M\\_B=\\Delta{M}=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}V\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{B'}-27=\\left[90(6.24-2)-\\frac{1}{3}(6.24-2)(90)\\right]\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{B'}=281.56kN•m\\\\)\nThe right side of the equation is the area of the positive plot of the shear region at segment \\\\(BC\\\\). In other words, it is the area of the shear region \\\\(BB'\\\\).\n###### Finding The Area\nThis section is a refresher on how to get the right side of the expression above. To get the area of the shear region, we use principles from Geometry or [Integral Calculus](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-the-area-of-a-curve-using-integration). In the solution above, we used the former approach.\nWe can think of the area as the difference between the rectangular area \\\\(A\\_a\\\\) and the spandrel area \\\\(A\\_b\\\\), \\\\(A=A\\_a-A\\_b\\\\).\n![Area between BB'](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455178d7fecadc388e6c883_WTS-Structure_23.007-10.png)\nThe area of the rectangle \\\\(A\\_a\\\\) is \\\\(bh\\\\) where \\\\(b\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) are the base and height, respectively.\n-   Variable \\\\(b\\\\) or the distance from \\\\(B\\\\) to \\\\(B'\\\\) is \\\\(6.24-2\\\\)\n-   Variable \\\\(h\\\\) is \\\\(90\\\\)\nThe area of a spandrel \\\\(A\\_b\\\\) is \\\\(\\frac{1}{n+1}bh\\\\) where \\\\(n\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(h\\\\) are the degree of the shear function, base, and height respectively. We base the variable \\\\(h\\\\) on the tangent line of the origin.\n-   The degree \\\\(n\\\\) is equal to 2\n-   Variable \\\\(b\\\\) or the distance from \\\\(B\\\\) to \\\\(B'\\\\) is \\\\(6.24-2\\\\)\n-   Variable \\\\(h\\\\) is \\\\(90\\\\) (based from the tangent line at \\\\(B\\\\))\nThe degree \\\\(n\\\\) of the shear function at segment \\\\(BC\\\\) is two (2) since we have a quadratic function. How do we know if it is such? From the moment and shear slope equations, we can deduce that the degree of an algebraic function decrements from moment to shear to load. The same is true in reverse - the degree increases from load to shear to moment.\nIn our example, the load in segment \\\\(BC\\\\) is linear, meaning it has a degree of one (linear function). From this, the degree of the shear graph must be two (quadratic function). If we continue even further, the degree of the moment graph will be three (cubic function).\nWe substitute these values to get the right side of the equation:\n\\\\(A=A\\_a-A\\_b\\\\)\n\\\\(A=\\left[90(6.24-2)-\\frac{1}{3}(6.24-2)(90)\\right]\\\\)\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope at said point, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(w\\_{B'}=\\frac{dV}{dx}=V\\_{B'}'\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{B'}'=0\\\\)\nA zero slope means that the tangent line through this point is horizontal.\n##### Endpoint C\n###### Moment Value\nNext, we consider the moment at point \\\\(C\\\\). To solve it, we will use the change in moment expression to find the value. From \\\\(B'\\\\):\n\\\\(M\\_C-M\\_{B'}=\\Delta{M}=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}V\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_C-281.56=\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(6.5-6.24)(-10.91)+\\frac{1}{3}(6.5-6.24)(-11.25+10.91)\\right]\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_C=280.12kN•m\\\\)\nThe right side of the equation is the area of the negative plot of the shear region at segment \\\\(BC\\\\). In other words, it is the area of the shear region \\\\(B'C\\\\).\n###### Finding the Area\nThis section is a refresher on how to get the right side of the expression above. To get the area of the shear region, we use principles from Geometry or Integral Calculus. In the solution above, we used the former approach.\n![Area between B'C](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645517a2d81d88d5fea2a9d0_WTS-Structure_23.007-11.png)\nWe can think of the area as the sum of the triangular area \\\\(A\\_a\\\\) and the spandrel area \\\\(A\\_b\\\\), \\\\(A=A\\_a+A\\_b\\\\).\nThe area of the triangle \\\\(A\\_a\\\\) is \\\\(\\frac{1}{2}bh\\\\) where \\\\(b\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) are the base and height respectively.\n-   Variable \\\\(b\\\\) or the distance from \\\\(B'\\\\) to \\\\(C\\\\) is \\\\(6.5-6.24\\\\)\nThe variable \\\\(h\\\\) would require additional steps. To solve it, we must use ratio and proportion with the shear slope at \\\\(B'\\\\).\nTo get the shear slope at \\\\(B'\\\\), we need to know that load at \\\\(B'\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{45}{4.5}=\\frac{w\\_{B'}}{6.42-2}\\\\)\n\\\\(w\\_{B'}=42.4\\\\)\nFrom the shear slope equation, the slope of the shear at point \\\\(B'\\\\) is:\n\\\\(w\\_{B'}=\\frac{dV}{dx}=V\\_{B'}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{B'}=42.4\\\\)\nWe can now use ratio and proportion to solve for \\\\(h\\\\):\n\\\\(\\frac{h}{6.5-6.24}=\\frac{42.4}{1}\\\\)\n\\\\(h=10.91\\\\)\nSince it is in the negative region, \\\\(h=-10.91\\\\).\nThe area of a spandrel \\\\(A\\_b\\\\) is \\\\(\\frac{1}{n+1}bh\\\\) where \\\\(n\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(h\\\\) are the degree of the shear function, base, and height respectively. We base the variable \\\\(h\\\\) on the tangent line of the origin.\n-   The degree \\\\(n\\\\) is equal to 2\n-   Variable \\\\(b\\\\) or the distance from \\\\(B\\\\) to \\\\(B'\\\\) is \\\\(6.5-6.24\\\\)\nThe variable \\\\(h\\\\) would require some additional steps. Remember, we must base \\\\(h\\\\) in the spandrel from the tangent line at \\\\(B'\\\\). We have the shear at point \\\\(C\\\\), which is \\\\(-11.25\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) from the triangle, which is \\\\(10.91\\\\). From these values, it is easy to solve it:\n\\\\(h=11.25-10.91\\\\)\n\\\\(h=0.34\\\\)\nSince it is in the negative region, \\\\(h=-0.34\\\\).\nWe substitute these values to get the right side of the equation:\n\\\\(A=A\\_a+A\\_b\\\\)\n\\\\(A=\\frac{1}{2}(6.5-6.24)(-10.91)+\\frac{1}{3}(6.5-6.24)(-0.34)\\\\)\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope at said point, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_C=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{C'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{C}'=-11.25\\\\)\nA negative slope means the tangent line plot must go downward (top-left to bottom-right).\n#### Point C\n![Point C](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645517e157a50681ee98e481_WTS-Structure_23.007-5.png)\nNext, we examine point \\\\(C\\\\) by itself.

Again, we need to find two things: (1) the moment and (2) its slope at its endpoints \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\).\n##### Endpoint C\n###### Moment Value\nFrom examining point \\\\(C\\\\), we saw that \\\\(M\\_C\\\\) is \\\\(280.12kN•m\\\\). Likewise, this segment's moment \\\\(M\\_C\\\\) is \\\\(280.12kN•m\\\\).\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_C=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{C'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{C}'=-11.25\\\\)\nA negative slope means the tangent line plot must go downward (top-left to bottom-right).\n##### Endpoint D\n###### Moment Value\nNext, we consider the moment at point \\\\(D\\\\).

The value is the sum of the rectangular and triangular areas.\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope at said point, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_D=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{D'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{D}'=-173.25kN•m\\\\)\nA negative slope means the tangent line plot must go downward (top-left to bottom-right).\n###### Point of Zero Moment\nGoing off-track for a bit, let's analyze the moment at endpoints \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\):\n\\\\(M\\_C=280.12kN•m\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_D=-135kN•m\\\\)\nWe can see that the moment at \\\\(C\\\\) was positive. When it reached point \\\\(D\\\\), it became negative. This incident means a point exists between \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) in which the moment becomes zero. At this point, the inflection point in the deflected shape will occur.\nThere are many ways to find this point. We can see the solution in this separate [post](/tree-posts/what-is-the-point-of-zero-moment). At the end of the article, the location of zero moment from the origin is at:\n\\\\(x=10.15\\\\)\n#### Point D\n![Point D](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551817cc73936b0f50e2ea_WTS-Structure_23.007-7.png)\nNext, we examine point \\\\(D\\\\) by itself. From the previous segment, the moment \\\\(M\\_{D}\\\\) is \\\\(-135kN•m\\\\); There is no discontinuity at this point; hence the moment is still the same.\n#### Segment DE\n![Segment DE](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455181f822de14f88d8e1fe_WTS-Structure_23.007-8.png)\nAfter examining point \\\\(D\\\\) and its moment, we move on to the adjacent segment \\\\(DE\\\\). Again, we need to find two things: (1) the moment and (2) its slope at its endpoints \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\).\n##### Endpoint D\n###### Moment Value\nFrom examining point \\\\(D\\\\), we saw that \\\\(M\\_D\\\\) is \\\\(-135kN•m\\\\). Likewise, this segment's moment \\\\(M\\_D\\\\) is \\\\(-135kN•m\\\\).\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_D=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{D'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{D}'=90\\\\)\nA positive slope means the tangent line plot must go upward (bottom-left to top-right).\n##### Endpoint E\n###### Moment Value\nNext, we consider the moment at point \\\\(E\\\\). To solve it, we will use the change in moment expression to find the value:\n\\\\(M\\_E-M\\_D=\\Delta{M}=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}V\\times{dx}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_E-(-135)=(12-11.5)(90)\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_E=0kN•m\\\\)\nThe right side of the equation is the area of the shear diagram at segment \\\\(DE\\\\)\n###### Slope\nIn terms of the slope at said point, we use the moment slope equation:\n\\\\(V\\_E=\\frac{dM}{dx}=M\\_{E'}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{E}'=90\\\\)\nA positive slope means the tangent line plot must go upward (bottom-left to top-right).\n#### Point E\n![Point E](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455183620480f3912c81229_WTS-Structure_23.007-9.png)\nFinally, we examine point \\\\(E\\\\) by itself. From the previous segment, the moment \\\\(M\\_{E}\\\\) is \\\\(0kN•m\\\\); There is no discontinuity at this point; hence the moment is still the same.\n### Drawing the Moment Diagram\nNow that we know the moment value and slope for each critical point per point and segment, we can finally construct the moment diagram per segment.\nThe moment values and slopes per segment are the following: \n#### Segment AB\n\\\\(M\\_A=27kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{A}'=0\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_B=27kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{B}'=0\\\\)\n#### Segment BC\n\\\\(M\\_B=27kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{B}'=90\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_B'=281.56kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{B'}'=0\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_C=280.12kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{C}'=-11.25\\\\)\n#### Segment CD\n\\\\(M\\_C=280.12kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{C}'=-11.25\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_D=-135kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{D}'=-173.25\\\\)\n#### Segment DE\n\\\\(M\\_D=-135kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{D}'=90\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_E=0kN•m\\\\), \\\\(M\\_{E}'=90\\\\)\nThese values are the information we need to draw the moment diagram. Plotting the moment values on a graph and drawing a tangent line along these points, we have the following chart:\n‍\nHow do we know if our diagram is correct? The moment must close back to zero when we analyze the final point. In this case, it closed \\\\(M\\_E=0kN•m\\\\) when we investigated point \\\\(E\\\\).\n",

      "Free Content": "There are many ways how to classify [structural loads](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-loads). In this post, we'll explore the general types one may encounter:\n## Dead Loads\n![Example of dead loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e59e28273c23620b9d20a_WTS-Structure_13-1.png)\nDead loads are permanent forces acting on the structure. We can further subdivide dead loads as either: \n-   Self-weight of the building itself\n-   Superimposed loads like ceilings, floor, fixed furniture or equipment attached to the building itself\nThe value of dead loads will depend on the structural code used. One standard procedure is to get the density of the construction material and multiply it by the volume of the structural component to get its mass. Another method is to use standardized dead loads from such codes.\n## Live Loads\n![Examples of live loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e59eb7c48951fa6a77d58_WTS-Structure_13-2.png)\nLoads that change in position and magnitude are live loads. We can further classify these into:\n-   Floor live loads due to the occupancy of people in buildings\n-   Roof live loads due to roof maintenance work, for example\n-   Moving live loads due to vehicles, trains, or moving equipment\nSome other live loads one may consider are moving equipment and machinery (such as elevators and cranes), helicopters, and impact forces.\nLike dead loads, the calculation of these live loads will depend on the structural code used. Most references already provide values for floor and roof live loads. \nWhen analyzing moving live loads, engineers will use a model vehicle (based on local standards) that will act as their structural load.\n## Wind Loads\n![Wind blowing through structures](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e59f4e42d31873a591e27_WTS-Structure_13-3.png)\nWind generates loads that can affect structures. This load is evident, especially in high-rise buildings or warehouses. \nThe computation of wind load will vary depending on many factors, such as wind speed, profile, and topography, to name a few. The calculation of such will also depend on the structural code.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Snow Loads\n![Heavy snowfall on structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a016f382a079bea2e8d_WTS-Structure_13-4.png)\nSnow loads are environmental loads applicable to structures expected to receive snowfall.\nSnow can accumulate and be deep as a ten-story building. If snow collects on top of a structure, it creates additional loads on the building. Like wind loads, there are many factors to consider, and the calculation will depend on the code.\n## Earthquake (or Seismic) Loads\n![Earthquake damaging a house](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a07e42d31479a591ef6_WTS-Structure_13-5.png)\nEarthquakes generate seismic loads that engineers must anticipate.\nThe computation of earthquake loads will depend again on the structural regulation. Since earthquakes are unpredictable, the codes will provide many approaches to computing them. Some factors to consider are the probability of an earthquake, its strength, and the distance to the nearest fault lines.\n## Earth Loads (or Pressure)\n![Tunnel with earth loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a0e092e07b43fb8d82a_WTS-Structure_13-6.png)\nFor tunnels, retaining walls, or below-grade structures, soil pressure (or soil-lateral loads) is another load to consider. It is the structural load due to soil and structure interaction.\nThe computation of soil pressure will require a sufficient understanding of soil mechanics. Structural codes will also have other requirements for this load type.\n## Water Loads (or Pressure)\n![Water exerting hydrostatic pressure on dams](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a186f382a8a34ea44b3_WTS-Structure_13-7.png)\nWater and ice are a concern for some, such as dams, tanks, flood barriers, bridges, offshore platforms, and coastal structures. It is the structural load due to water and structure interaction. Examples of these loads include:\n-   Hydrostatic pressure\n-   Uplift loads in soil from the water table\n-   Rain or ponding loads from accumulated water on the roof or building surface\n-   Flood loads\n-   Dynamic loads such as wave impact\n-   Floating ice (solid water) are loads that can hit offshore platforms\nSome of these loads can cause damaging effects, such as scouring to bridge piers. The computation of these loads will again depend on the structural codes and accepted practices.\n## Self-Straining Loads\n![Sun expanding metal - an example of self-straining loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a20e42d317abc592051_WTS-Structure_13-8.png)\nOther loads one should consider are self-straining forces. These forces typically expand or contract structural elements. These include: \n-   Temperature changes due to heat\n-   Creep and shrinkage of concrete\n-   Moisture change in materials\n-   The differential settlement, such as observed in soil\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> There are many ways how to classify structural loads.\n> Dead loads are permanent forces acting on the structure, either self-weight or superimposed.\n> Loads that change in position and magnitude are live loads. Examples include floor-live loads, roof-live loads, and moving loads.\n> Wind loads are environmental loads due to the wind.\n> Snow loads are environmental loads applicable to structures expected to receive snowfall.\n> Earthquakes (or Seismic) Loads are loads that an earthquake produces.\n> Earth load (or pressure) is a structural load due to the soil and structure interaction.\n> Water load (or pressure) is a structural load due to the static or dynamic water and structure interaction.\n> Self-straining loads are forces that typically expand or contract structural elements.\n",

      "Free Content": "Deflection, at its basic dictionary definition, is an act of moving out from its course. In [structural analysis](/tree-posts/introduction-to-structural-analysis), this has a similar concept.\n## Deflection, Neutral Shape, and Deflected Shape\n![Difference among neutral shape, deflected shape, and deflection ](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64574f1b5d2f112be398d8ae_WTS-Structure_26-1.png)\nEvery object/[structure](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structure) has an initial position called the neutral shape - the structure's shape when no [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads) are applied. When it experiences loads, every structural point will deform (change shape) and deflect (move) from its original position. The resulting shape is what we call its deflected shape. \nThe measure of how much a point moved from its original place is what we call deflection. Part of any structural analysis is to investigate this behavior.\nNaturally, when a structure deflects, it will try to resist it. This property is what we call [rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity). Later on, we will see how it fits with the topic.\n## Types of Deflection\n![Translation versus rotation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64574f3513de7837a64ed69f_WTS-Structure_26-2.png)\nLet's move on to deflection types. There are two types of deflection: linear (translation) and angular (rotation).\nThe first type, translation, measures how much a point in the structure has moved from its original position. It may translate a few millimeters from its neutral position.\nOn the other hand, the second type, rotation, measures how much a point in the structure has rotated from its original position. It may rotate by a few degrees from its initial position.\n## Notation\nFor this reference, we will use the following convention when naming deflections:\n### Real Load Notation\n![Real load notation for deflection](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64574f419178cbcb11353856_WTS-Structure_26-3.png)\nIf a structure experiences actual loads, the notation for deflections is the following:\n-   Linear translation \\\\(\\Delta\\\\). For horizontal components, it is either \\\\(\\Delta\\_h\\\\) or \\\\(\\Delta\\_x\\\\). On the other hand, for vertical components, it is either \\\\(\\Delta\\_v\\\\) or \\\\(\\Delta\\_y\\\\)\n-   Angular translation / Rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\)\nThe translation is the uppercase Greek letter delta \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), while rotation is the Greek letter theta \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n## Components\n![Deflection in 2D and 3D space](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64574f60ac69a31e96ec11c0_WTS-Structure_26-4.png)\nLet's consider a structure with a pre-defined grid. A point in the structure may translate along the \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(y\\\\), and \\\\(z\\\\)-axes. Likewise, it may rotate about the \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(y\\\\), and \\\\(z\\\\)-axes.\nWe may represent these deflections as a single result, but it's usually best to break them down into their components.\n-   When we are considering a [3D structure](/tree-posts/plane-and-spatial-structures), there would be six deflection components: translation in the \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(y\\\\), and \\\\(z\\\\) and the rotations about the \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(y\\\\), and \\\\(z\\\\).\n-   For [2D structures](/tree-posts/plane-and-spatial-structures), there are only three deflection components: translation in the \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(y\\\\), and the rotation about the \\\\(z\\\\).\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Every object/structure has an initial position called the neutral shape - the structure's shape when no loads are applied.\n> When it experiences loads, every structural point will deform (change shape) and deflect (move) from its original position.

These may be a series of beams and columns arranged in some configuration.\nThe construction of these components will entirely depend on the function of the frame. \nFor instance, if we are to design a frame structure for a temporary warehouse:\n-   It must be capable of carrying all sorts of [structural loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads) - dead loads, live loads, and lateral loads.\n-   It must be lightweight so that it's easy to assemble and disassemble.\n### Joints Connect Members\n![Joints connect members](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453bb00d918be05f0a6eeb9_WTS-Structure_3.18-2.png)\nThe members of the frame are connected at their ends by _[joints](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections)_. These connections can be rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible. \nWhen discussing structural frames, one usually assumes that its joints are stiff unless otherwise stated.\nThe construction of joints will depend on the material and its structural purpose. For instance:\n-   For structural steel frames, joints can be riveted, bolted, or welded. Depending on the section and configuration of these connections, it can be any of the three types. For instance, when we fuse the flange and web of an I-beam to a column, it is a rigid connection.\n-   For reinforced concrete frames, rigid joints are formed by monolithically pouring concrete on member connections.\n## How Do Frames Behave?\n![Frame components experience axial, shear, flexural, and torsional stresses](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453bb06503f6d0870ff99bd_WTS-Structure_3.18-3.png)\nKnowing how the frame behaves is crucial in structural analysis.

Roof trusses, transmission towers, construction tower cranes, and even the famous Eiffel Tower are all examples of trusses.\nThere are many uses for trusses! For example, it is used in bridge construction, especially for long-span bridges, in roller coasters as track rails, and in scaffolding works as temporary structures.\n## What Makes a Truss?\n### Components Form a Truss\n![Trusses mainly compose of two components: joints and members](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453b240e16914796aed4789_WTS-Structure_3.1-1.png)\nThere are at least two critical components of a truss: the long slender materials called _[members](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member)_ and their connection at their ends called _[joints](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections)_. The members can be made of different [materials](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material), [shapes](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section), and sizes, while the joints can be any connection, such as bolts or welds.\nA truss's construction will depend on its [purpose](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structure). For instance, if we are to design a truss structure for light and sound rigging at concerts:\n-   It must be capable of carrying sound and lighting equipment.\n-   It must be lightweight so that transportation is easy.\n-   It must be easily assembled and disassembled.\n### Truss is Rigid\n![As a unit, a truss must be rigid](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453b24a5ee09b328c277966_WTS-Structure_3.1-2.png)\nWhen we speak of trusses, they should be able to retain their shape when applied with loads. It should behave as one structure. In other words, it should be rigid. \nUsually, we create trusses with triangle arrangements in space. Now, why a triangle? Well, it's the most robust shape! The triangle makes it perfect for achieving the rigidity we need for the truss.\nThere are some unique trusses where the members form other shapes, such as hexagons, so we're not limited to triangles. What's important is that the members and joints must act together to satisfy their intended purpose.\n## **How Do Trusses Behave?**\n![The members of the truss predominantly experience axial forces](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453b2504006f96b0f079461_WTS-Structure_3.1-3.png)\nIf a force acts on a joint, all truss members are affected. Meaning each component will share the stress due to the applied load.\nLater in this course, we'll discover that these members will predominantly experience axial stresses, which can be tension or compression.\n## Summary\n> The truss is an assemblage of various members in space.\n> We call the long slender objects of the truss: _members._ The end connection of each member is called a _joint._\n> The truss's assemblage work as one to resist loads imposed on it. It behaves as one structure.\n> The truss's members will predominantly experience axial stresses, which can be tension or compression.\n",

      "Free Content": "One of the fundamental forces of nature is the gravitational force. In this post, we'll explore more about it.\n## Basics\nLet's start expanding what gravitational force \\\\(F\\_g\\\\) is. In elementary Physics, we may quickly refer to it as weight. From Newton's second law of motion, we can express gravitation force as:\n\\\\(F\\_g=mg\\\\)\n-   \\\\(m\\\\) is mass\n-   \\\\(g\\\\) is the acceleration due to gravity\nMass \\\\(m\\\\) is a scalar quantity; however, the variable \\\\(g\\\\) is an acceleration vector quantity which means it has both magnitude and direction. As such, the sign of \\\\(g\\\\) matters, which would depend on the situation. On Earth, \\\\(g\\\\) is around \\\\(9.81 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\) or \\\\(32.1 \\frac{ft}{s^2}\\\\). \n## Deriving Acceleration Due to Gravity\n![Deriving Earth's acceleration due to gravity](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e36335617d2402de2e2042_WTS-1-Physics_GravitationalForce-1.png)\nHave you ever wondered how acceleration \\\\(g\\\\) is derived? \nTo answer this question, we recall what gravity is. By its essence, it is simply an invisible pulling force \\\\(F\\_g\\\\) between objects.\nWe measure this pulling force using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation which states that:\n\\\\(F\\_g=\\frac{G m\\_1 m\\_2}{r^2}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(G\\\\) is the gravitation constant (6.674×10−11 \\\\(m^3 \\cdot kg^−1 \\cdot s^−2\\\\))\n-   \\\\(m\\_1\\\\) is the mass of the first object\n-   \\\\(m\\_2\\\\) is the mass of the second object.\n-   \\\\(r\\\\) refers to the distance between the center of masses between the two objects.\nLet's consider the interaction between a random body with mass \\\\(m\\_1\\\\) and our planet Earth with mass \\\\(m\\_2\\\\). Our goal is to try and solve \\\\(F\\_g\\\\)\n-   Our object has a mass \\\\(m\\\\) while Earth has a mass equal to \\\\(5.972 × 10^{24} kg\\\\). Due to gravity, these objects will tend to pull toward each other.\n-   For \\\\(r\\\\), we determine the distance between the center of masses between Earth and the object. Ideally, it would be the sum of Earth's equivalent radius (6371 km) and the extra distance needed to reach the object's center of mass; however, the latter is so minuscule compared to the Earth's radius that it bears no significant impact on the computation of the pulling force; hence, we'll assume that \\\\(r\\\\) is equal to 6371 km.\nWith these values, we can say that the pulling force between Earth and the object is:\n\\\\(F\\_g=\\frac{\\left(6.674 \\times 10^{-11}\\right)\\left(5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\right)}{(6371 \\times 1000)^2} \\times m\\\\)\nEvaluating this expression will yield:\n\\\\(F\\_g \\approx 9.81 \\times m\\\\)\nThe computed figure, 9.81, is a conservative acceleration value due to gravity \\\\(g\\\\) in SI units. It's how we arrived at our constant value.\nFrom this discussion, the primary variables affecting acceleration due to gravity are the mass of the objects and the center-to-center distance between them. As such, the constant 9.81 only applies to an object here on Earth.\nIn addition, our derivation assumes that the Earth is a perfect sphere, but it is an oblate spheroid. It implies that \\\\(r\\\\) varies depending on where you are on Earth. In practice, we use the traditional value of \\\\(9.80665 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\).\n## Summary\n> Gravitational force \\\\(F\\_g\\\\) deals with the pulling force between two objects due to gravity.\n> In elementary Physics, it is weight.\n> Mathematically, it is equal to the product of scalar mass \\\\(m\\\\) and vector acceleration due to gravity \\\\(g\\\\)\n> On Earth, \\\\(g\\\\) is around \\\\(9.81 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\) or \\\\(32.1 \\frac{ft}{s^2}\\\\).\n> We derive this constant \\\\(g\\\\) from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation which states that: \\\\(F\\_g=\\frac{G m\\_1 m\\_2}{r^2}\\\\). \\\\(G\\\\) is the gravitation constant (6.674×10−11 \\\\(m^3 \\cdot kg^−1 \\cdot s^−2\\\\)), \\\\(m\\_1\\\\) is the mass of the first object, \\\\(m\\_2\\\\) is the mass of the second object, and \\\\(r\\\\) refers to the distance between the center of masses between the two objects.\n> From this, the primary variables affecting acceleration due to gravity are the mass of the objects and the center-to-center distance between them.\n> It implies that \\\\(g\\\\) will change if we are on a different planet and closer or farther to the object's center. In practice, we use the traditional value of \\\\(9.80665 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\) here on Earth.\n",

Strain energy is the area of the product of these two graphs.\n## Key Idea: Virtual Work Due to Flexural Strains\nNow that we have solved for \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\delta}\\\\), let's equate it back to the general virtual work equation:\nVirtual Work - Flexural Strains - Horizontal Translation: \\\\(1{\\times}\\Delta\\_h=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}\\frac{Mm\\_h}{EI}dx\\\\)\nVirtual Work - Flexural Strains - Vertical Translation: \\\\(1{\\times}\\Delta\\_v=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}\\frac{Mm\\_v}{EI}dx\\\\)\nVirtual Work - Flexural Strains - Rotation: \\\\(1{\\times}\\theta=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}\\frac{Mm\\_\\alpha}{EI}dx\\\\)\nHere is the meaning of the variables in those equations:\n-   The unit force or couple represents the fictional unit load applied to the virtual structure.\n-   \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) (or \\\\(\\theta\\\\)) describe the components we would like to investigate.\n-   \\\\(M\\\\) is the bending moment equation caused by real loadings (usually a function of position \\\\(x\\\\))\n-   \\\\(m\\_v\\\\), \\\\(m\\_h\\\\), \\\\(m\\_\\alpha\\\\) are the bending moment equations caused by the unit loading of the virtual structure.\n-   \\\\(EI\\\\) is [flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity).\n-   Limits \\\\(x\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(x\\_2\\\\) are the member's local start and end coordinates, respectively.\nThese equations are the expressions we will use to solve for flexural deflection in structures such as beams or frames. Later on, we'll use a beam [example](/tree-posts/how-to-use-virtual-work-to-solve-flexural-deflections) on how to apply this set of equations to solve for translation and rotation.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> The expression for the superimposed fictional strain energy due to flexural strains is \\\\(U\\_{s\\_\\delta}=\\int\\frac{Mm}{EI}dx\\\\).\n> It is the area of the product of two graphs: the virtual beam with its moment diagram and the superimposed beam with its \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\) diagram.\n> The equations we will use to solve for the deflections are the following: (1) \\\\(1{\\times}\\Delta\\_h=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}\\frac{Mm\\_h}{EI}dx\\\\), (2) \\\\(1{\\times}\\Delta\\_v=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}\\frac{Mm\\_v}{EI}dx\\\\), and (3) \\\\(1{\\times}\\theta=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2}\\frac{Mm\\_\\alpha}{EI}dx\\\\).\n",

All members are assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material).\n![Rigid portal frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6458d282aa29102b33e9079f_WTS-Structure_25.02-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe frame has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A \\\\(30kN (6.74kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\n-   A uniform load of \\\\(15kN/m (1.03kip/ft)\\\\).\n-   A \\\\(10kN (2.25kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Frame, Determinate Frame_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\n##### Global References\n![Global references of rigid portal frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64562319ba466a9ef3bb05dc_WTS-Structure_25.02-2.png)\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the bottom-left point of the frame. Consequently, the x-axis will run horizontally with the y-axis perpendicular to it.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of supports, change in loads, and differences in the frame's cross-sectional properties. Starting from \\\\(A\\\\) and going around the structure, we identify the following points of interest: \n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The roller support.\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 6.0m), B(0.0ft, 19.69ft)\\\\). Frame joint and the start of the uniform distributed load of \\\\(15kN/m (1.03kip/ft)\\\\) **↓**\n-   \\\\(C(4.0m, 6.0m), C(13.12ft, 19.69ft)\\\\). Frame joint, the end of the uniform distributed load of\\\\(15kN/m (1.03kip/ft)\\\\) **↓**, and the \\\\(10kN (2.25kip)\\\\) concentrated load acting to the left\n-   \\\\(D(4.0m, 1.0m), D(13.12ft, 3.28ft)\\\\). The hinge support, and\n-   \\\\(E(0.0m, 3.0m), E(0ft, 9.84ft)\\\\). The \\\\(30kN (6.74kip)\\\\) concentrated load acting to the right.\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n##### Local References\n![Local references of rigid portal frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64562326ba466a7892bb0687_WTS-Structure_25.02-3.png)\nWhen dealing with structures composed of elements with varying properties and internal forces along their length, we need to create a localized reference system for each. It is a common step, especially when dealing with structural frames.\nThe first step would be to break the frame into its members. \nThen, we analyze each member separately and assign a location of the local origin. Usually, we place it at the left-most part of the member when looking inside the frame. You can put it on the right-most side - there is no hard rule. What's important is consistency, and it must be understandable. The x-axis would go along the length of the member while the y-axis would run perpendicular to it. \nFinally, from the selected origin, we label each point of interest.\nLet's illustrate how we can create our local system for each member. In our frame example, we have three members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), and \\\\(CD\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(AB\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(A\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(E(3.0m, 0.0m), E(9.84ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(B(6.0m, 0.0m), B(19.69ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(BC\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(B\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 0.0m), B(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(C(4.0m, 0.0m), C(13.12ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(CD\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(C\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(C(0.0m, 0.0m), C(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(D(5.0m, 0.0m), D(16.40ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor a 2D frame, it is:\n\\\\(D=(3m+r)-(3j+c)\\\\)\nFor this frame example, there are three members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), four joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and three reaction components: \\\\(R\\_A\\\\), \\\\(D\\_h\\\\), \\\\(D\\_v\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=(3(3)+3)-(3(4)+0)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-frame-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(R\\_A, D\\_h, D\\_v\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the frame is externally stable. In terms of its internal stability, the frame arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Reaction analysis of rigid portal frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6456233816ee127d0a8531fb_WTS-Structure_25.02-4.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(D\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left, and \n-   \\\\(R\\_A\\\\) and \\\\(D\\_v\\\\) are acting upwards.\nThen, applying the equilibrium equations (to the global system):\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\rightarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(30-10-D\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_h=20kN (4.5kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_D}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_A(4)+30(5-3)-15(4)(\\frac{1}{2}\\times4)-10(5)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_A=27.5kN (6.18kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(27.5+D\\_v-15(4)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_v=32.5kN (7.31kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components of the structure are: \n\\\\(R\\_A=27.5kN (6.18kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_h=20kN (4.5kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_v=32.5kN (7.31kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._\nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn 2D frames, we limit to axial, shear, and moment only.\n##### Modeling Axial, Shear, and Moment Behavior\nWe can use axial, shear, and moment equations and graphs to describe the internal behavior of each frame member.\nCreating these equations and diagrams deserves a separate section. Learn more about how to construct these using these individual posts:\n-   [Axial Forces](/tree-posts/modeling-axial-force)\n-   [Shear and Moment Equations and Diagrams](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment)\n##### Local System\nThe following section shows each frame member's axial, shear, and moment behavior in the local system. _You can view the complete solution in this_ _[link](/tree/force-analysis-rigid-portal-frame)._\n##### Member AB\n##### Member BC\n##### Member CD\n##### Global System\nThe following section shows all frame members' combined axial, shear, and moment diagrams.\n![Combined axial, shear, and moment diagrams of rigid portal frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64591296b68c6317060db88f_WTS-Structure_PortalFrame_001.png)\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as the following:\n-   [Area Moment Method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-area-moment-method)\n-   [Virtual Work Method](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work)\n_The author will post the mathematical solution for this example soon. In the meantime, we can describe its deflection_ _[qualitatively](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflections-qualitatively)._\n-   When the member experiences a negative moment, the member concaves downward, locally speaking (as in member \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), and \\\\(CD\\\\))\n-   The roller support restricts vertical translation at that point but is free to move horizontally or rotate.\n-   The hinge support restricts the frame's translation at that point but is free to rotate.\n-   Interconnected joints, such as in \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), have the same deformation.\n-   The joints rotated but maintained their rigidity.\n",

The object consists of a uniform cross-section throughout its whole length. We generated the solid by revolving the area along its axis of rotation, which must lie along the area boundary. \nWe must divide the solid into multiple parts to estimate the total volume. We can imagine these parts as a series of similar plane sections stacked on each other to make up the 3D object.\nFor a solid of revolution, we can divide it into a disc or a shell. For this post, we will be using small discs - thin prisms with a circular base.\nFrom this, we begin the process of approximating:\n1.  First, divide the 3D object into multiple regular discs.\n2.  Then, we solve the volume \\\\(V\\\\) of each divided disc. From Cavalieri's theorem, \\\\(V=Ah\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is the uniform cross-sectional area and \\\\(h\\\\) is the length of the solid. Since it is a circular disc, \\\\(A\\\\) is equal to \\\\(\\pi r^2\\\\) where \\\\(r\\\\) is its radius.\n3.  Finally, we add all individual \\\\(V\\\\) to get the total approximate volume.\nSince this is an approximation, how can we have a more accurate answer? We increase the number of discs \\\\(n\\\\). \n-   When we increase the number of discs, it will be closer to the actual value. \n-   As the number of discs increases, the smaller its volume \\\\(dV\\\\) and thickness \\\\(h\\\\) become.\n",

Building from this, we can solve the precise volume. We will only need to modify two things in the approximate solution: \n-   We need to set up a solid disc that is so small we can express its volume as the differential \\\\(dV\\\\)\n-   We need an operation that will sum up all of these tiny divisions\nWe can combine all \\\\(dV\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the volume \\\\(V\\_T\\\\) is:\n\\\\(V\\_T=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dV}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(V\\_T\\\\) is the total volume\n-   \\\\(dV\\\\) is the differential volume of the division.\n-   \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value)\n-   \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\nThis equation is similar to solving the volume of solids using integration with [uniform cross-sections](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-volume-using-integration).

Let's investigate two cases:\n-   The first graph represents work performed with constant force \n-   The other one represents work for the variable force.\nWork is the area under the curve for these situations. \nIn the case of the first graph, the curve is a straight line (or a constant function); hence, work is the area of the rectangle:\n\\\\(W=F \\cdot \\Delta\\_x\\\\)\nIt corresponds to the formula for work in the beginning.\nMoving to the second graph, we can observe that the force can be any math function. Since the curve varies, to find the area, we use one of the [key applications of definite integration](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-the-area-of-a-curve-using-integration):\n\\\\(W=\\int\\_{x\\_1}^{x\\_2} F(x) \\cdot d x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(W\\\\) is the total work done\n-   \\\\(x\\_1\\\\) is the lower limit (the initial position)\n-   \\\\(x\\_2\\\\) is the upper limit (the final position)\n-   \\\\(F(x)\\\\) is the variable force as a function of position \\\\(x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(dx\\\\) is the differential position \nThis equation is the general work equation that would encompass all instances, including the constant force situation.

The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\n## Main Solution\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Sample Solution\nThe following section shows how to use the method of joints:\n#### Joint A\n![Free body diagram of Joint A](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd10e14ea8b533be6eb2_WTS-Structure_21.04-1.png)\nWe first start analyzing the free-body diagram of a [joint](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections) with only two unknown forces. The strategy is to use the [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations for each free-body component; For 2D trusses, we can only use two. One joint that meets the condition is joint \\\\(A\\\\).\nLet's identify the forces acting on it: the [reaction](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) and \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), and joint connection forces \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\). In terms of the joint force's direction, we assume it. Let's say it acts away from the joint. We can solve the joint connection forces by applying the equilibrium equations as follows:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(6.33+F\\_{AB}\\sin60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AB}=-7.31kN\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(20+7.31\\cos60-F\\_{AC}=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AC}=23.66kN\\\\)\nAs you can see, we have solved for the joint connection force \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\). If the answer is negative, we have the wrong assumption, and the correct direction is its opposite. In this case, \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) should be towards the joint.\n#### Member AB\n![Free body diagram of Member AB](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd17bc4ac11f8849d31e_WTS-Structure_21.04-2.png)\nNow that we have forces \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\), we can analyze the adjacent free body diagrams, such as member \\\\(AB\\\\) and \\\\(AC\\\\), and determine the internal bar force for each member.\nLet's look at member \\\\(AB\\\\). Using Newton's Third Law, \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) on the joint must exert a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the connecting end of member \\\\(AB\\\\). Now, for the whole member to be in equilibrium, it must have a force \\\\(F\\_{BA}\\\\) that is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) at the other end of the member. \nSince \\\\(AB\\\\) is a straight member, the bar force is the computed \\\\(7.31kN\\\\). At this point, we now know one of the internal forces of the truss member.\nPart of the analysis is also to know whether this axial force is either tension \\\\(T\\\\) or compression \\\\(C\\\\). In this case, the two forces \\\\(F\\_{AB}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{BA}\\\\) cause member \\\\(AB\\\\) to shorten; So, the internal bar force in member \\\\(AB\\\\) is a compressive axial force. If these two end forces cause the member to elongate, it is a tensile force.\nAfter analyzing the member, we repeat the process of transferring the force from the member to the next adjacent joint (with at most two unknowns) and repeat what we did in the first step.\n### Full Solution\nThis section shows the complete solution of the internal bar forces using the method of joints:\n#### Joint B\n![Free body diagram of Joint B](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd2c545aff7821eb6db4_WTS-Structure_21.04-3.png)\nFrom Member AB, let's transfer the bar force on its end and proceed with Joint B. We have two unknowns: \\\\(F\\_{BC}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{BD}\\\\). Let's solve these:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(7.31\\sin60-F\\_{BC}\\sin60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{BC}=7.31kN (T)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(7.31\\cos60+7.31\\cos60+20-F\\_{BD}=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{BD}=27.31kN (C)\\\\)\nAfter solving for these bar forces, we would transfer these joint connection forces to their adjacent member and analyze them again; however, since our example consists of straight members, we can already interpret the bar force from the joints; hence, there is no need to analyze each member separately. Starting at this point, we would only investigate the joints after solving the joint unknowns.\n#### Joint C\n![Free body diagram of Joint C](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd375c88a32eda3cae83_WTS-Structure_21.04-4.png)\nNow that we know bar force \\\\(F\\_{CA}=F\\_{AC}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{CB}=F\\_{BC}\\\\), let's move to adjacent Joint C. We have two unknowns: \\\\(F\\_{CD}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{CE}\\\\). Let's solve these:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(7.31\\sin60+F\\_{CD}\\sin60-40=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{CD}=38.88kN (T)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{CE}+38.88\\cos60-23.66-7.31\\cos60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{CE}=7.88kN (T)\\\\)\n#### Joint G\n![Free body diagram of Joint G](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd421ddcb0d704e50ffe_WTS-Structure_21.04-5.png)\nAt this point, we have solved six bar forces out of eleven. From Joint C, we can continue to its adjacent joints; however, to demonstrate that we can start anywhere, let's go to Joint G. We have two unknowns: \\\\(F\\_{GF}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{GE}\\\\). Let's solve these:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{GF} \\sin 60-10=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{GF}=11.55kN (T)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{GE}-11.55\\cos 60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{GE}=5.78kN (C)\\\\)\n#### Joint F\n![Free body diagram of Joint F](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd4b545aff39f6eb714b_WTS-Structure_21.04-6.png)\nNow that we know bar force \\\\(F\\_{FG}=F\\_{GF}\\\\), let's move to adjacent Joint F. We have two unknowns: \\\\(F\\_{FD}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{FE}\\\\). Let's solve these:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{FE}\\sin60-11.55\\sin60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{FE}=11.55kN (C)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(11.55\\cos60+11.55\\cos60-F\\_{FD}=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{FD}=11.55kN (T)\\\\)\n#### Joint E\n![Free body diagram of Joint E](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd55a50b9c631163431e_WTS-Structure_21.04-7.png)\nNow that we know bar force \\\\(F\\_{EF}=F\\_{FE}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{EG}=F\\_{GE}\\\\), let's move to adjacent Joint E. We have only one unknown: \\\\(F\\_{DE}\\\\). Let's solve it:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{ED}\\sin60+43.67-11.55\\sin60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{ED}=-38.88 (C)\\\\)\n### Check Your Results\nWhen we do the method of joints, typically, the number of joints we need to analyze would be the number of joints in the truss less one.\nThe joint that was not analyzed is a great way to double-check our answers. The values we've computed must comply with the equilibrium principle.\n#### Joint D\n![Free body diagram of Joint D](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cd5db03b84a496ec5048_WTS-Structure_21.04-8.png)\nTo illustrate, let's analyze the final joint, joint D, and see if our answers are correct. Applying the equilibrium principle:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(38.88\\sin60-38.88\\sin60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(0=0\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(27.31+11.55-38.88\\cos60-38.88\\cos60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(0=0\\\\)\n## Summarise Your Results\nWe have finally solved all 11 bar forces! After analysis, it is always a good idea to summarise your results using a table. When summarizing, it's always great to [categorize](/tree-posts/what-are-the-parts-of-a-truss) your results for easy reference (top chords, bottom chords, and web members).\n‍\nWe can solve this truss example using the [method of sections](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-sections) also.\n",

      "Free Content": "Structural loads have different properties that we must know when analyzing structures. There are five critical characteristics:\n## Spatial Application\n![Spatial application of loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a92f6147e767868ed11_WTS-Structure_14-1.png)\nThis property refers to the _area in space_ where the load is applied. Generally, it can be: [a moment, a concentrated point, a distributed length, or a planar area](/tree-posts/how-do-loads-apply-on-a-structure).\n## Load Duration\n![Load duration may be permanent or temporary](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5a99de25a4a00f44f720_WTS-Structure_14-2.png)\nDuration tells us the period of a load acting on the structure. It can be permanent or temporary:\n-   The [self-weight of the building](/tree-posts/what-are-the-types-of-structural-loads) itself is typically a permanent or long-term load.\n-   [Live loads and environmental loads](/tree-posts/what-are-the-types-of-structural-loads) may be temporary or short-term. These loads last for a short period. For example, typhoons/hurricanes/cyclones only last for several days - it is rare to encounter these in an extended time frame.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Nature\n![Difference between static and dynamic loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5aa0e42d31aa895928b0_WTS-Structure_14-3.png)\nGenerally, we can classify loads as either static or dynamic:\n-   Static loads are loads that do not generate acceleration effects on the structure. Examples would include most dead loads (self-weight, weight of objects, and more).\n-   Dynamic loads generate acceleration effects on the structure. An earthquake is a perfect example. When it strikes, the building will be in motion.\nIn the case of live loads, it may be static or dynamic, depending on how structural codes treat them. We usually describe live loads as a percentage of something. In this way, we treat the dynamic nature of live loads as static.\n## Rate of Application\n![Examples of impusive, quasi-static, and cyclic loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5aa82db706e6c7fa3b34_WTS-Structure_14-4.png)\nAnother factor is how nature applies loads when introduced into the structure.\nGenerally, there are three types: impulsive, quasi-static, and cyclic.\n-   Impulsive loads are forces that are applied suddenly. A direct collision between a car and a structure is an example.\n-   A load that gradually increases and then stabilizes is called a quasi-static load. It's a force that has some resemblance to static loads. An example of which is a steady wind load hitting a structure. At first, the magnitude of the load is relatively low; as the wind gradually blows stronger, so does its strength. Eventually, the steady wind will reach a maximum point. When that happens, the magnitude also reaches a limit.\n-   Cyclic loads, as the name suggests, are loads repeating in nature. When an earthquake strikes, for instance, it creates cyclic loads. Structures sway left and right due to forces that are equal in magnitude but constantly changing in direction – a property of cyclic loads.\n## Load Certainty\n![All loads have a probability of occurring](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5ab099ad885fdaa13f43_WTS-Structure_14-5.png)\nAll loads have a probability of occurring. For example, \n-   What is the chance that n number of people will occupy the building?\n-   What is the chance of a building experiencing major catastrophic events such as earthquakes, typhoons, and floods?\nLoad probability is an essential factor in load analysis. Some loads have a good chance of occurring. Other loads have an unlikely case of occurring, like natural catastrophic events (however, these usually carry high loads). \nWe need to identify this occurrence to anticipate if the structure will meet these loads during its design life.\n## Summary\n> Structural loads have different properties that we must know when analyzing structures.\n> Spatial application refers to the _area in space_ where the load is applied.\n> Duration tells us the period of a force acting on a building.\n> Nature property refers to the classification of loads as either static or dynamic. Static loads are loads that do not generate acceleration effects on the structure while dynamic loads cause acceleration effects on the structure.\n> The Rate of Application refers to how nature applies loads when introduced into the structure.\n> Load Certainty deals with the probability of a structural load occurring throughout its design life.\n",

It is the product of Young's Modulus \\\\(E\\\\) and the moment of inertia \\\\(I\\\\) of a cross-section.\n\\\\(k\\_f=EI\\\\)\n### Axial\nThis type measures a structure's resistance to axial loads. It is the product of Young's Modulus \\\\(E\\\\) and the area \\\\(A\\\\) of a cross-section.\n\\\\(k\\_a=EA\\\\)\n### Torsional\nThis type measures a structure's resistance to torsion. It is the product of Shear Modulus \\\\(G\\\\) and the polar moment of inertia \\\\(J\\\\) of a cross-section.\n\\\\(k\\_t=JG\\\\)\n## Implications\nFrom these different types, we can observe that rigidity is a product of two variables: (1) the inertial properties of the cross-section and (2) the mechanical property of a material.\nIt implies several things when it comes to the structure's deflection or deformation:\n-   Rigidity will depend on the cross-section. For example, if we have a [tapered beam](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-longitudinally), the rigidity on its bigger end is more significant than its other end. It means that the smaller end is more prominent to deform or deflect.\n-   If we want our structure to deform/deflect less, for example, there are two things we can do. First, we may increase its mechanical properties \\\\(E\\\\) or \\\\(G\\\\). It implies that we must find a better material to carry the loads. Second, we may have a larger cross-section. What this does is increase its inertial properties. A bigger \\\\(I\\\\) or \\\\(J\\\\) means the structure will deform less.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> A fundamental property in any structure is its ability to resist deflection or deformation. We call this rigidity (or stiffness) \\\\(k\\\\).\n> There are several types of rigidity: flexural, axial, and torsional. Each rigidity respectively measures resistance with bending, axial, and torsion loads.\n> Rigidity is a product of two variables: (1) the inertial properties of the cross-section and (2) the mechanical property of a material.\n",

This example presents a case of axial strains.\n_The solution presented is in SI. The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\nTo start, we shall consider a [simple truss](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-trusses). It has a \\\\(20 kN\\\\) point load at \\\\(E\\\\). The value inside the parenthesis () is the member's cross-sectional area \\\\(A\\\\) in square centimeters. \nSay that we are interested in finding the rotation of member \\\\(CE\\\\).

It represents the rotation of said member - the thing we want to solve. We apply a pair of equal and parallel forces at the ends of member \\\\(DE\\\\). We'll assume that the rotation of the member is clockwise; hence, the effect of these two forces should be the same.\n### Formulate S, A, and E Equations\n![Bar forces S of real truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a9483f03efd56cb5d02a_WTS-Structure_31.006-2.png)\nWith a placeholder introduced, we formulate axial equations \\\\(S\\\\), \\\\(A\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\) based on the real and placeholder loads.\nWe get \\\\(S\\\\) using the [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) or [sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections).

      "Free Content": "From our discussion on [real work](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-real-work), we have stressed that the general real work equation has its limitation. \nDespite [this constraint](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-real-work), however, it is still possible to use the concept of real work to solve deflections at any point. To expound, we need to consult the works of the Italian mathematician and engineer Carlo Alberto Castigliano.\n## Castigliano's Theorems\nHe made two theorems related to the analysis of structures. The basic premise of his theorems revolves around the relationships of strain energy \\\\(U\\\\), force \\\\(F\\\\), and deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) using partial derivatives. \nThe first theorem states that:\n> \"The partial derivative of the total strain energy U to translation (or rotation) at a point is equal to the force (or moment) applied at said point in the line of direction of the deflection. \"\nCastigliano’s First Theorem: \\\\(\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial\\Delta}=F\\\\)\nOn the other hand, the second theorem states the following:\n> \"The partial derivative of the total strain energy U to a force (or moment) at a point is equal to the translation (or rotation) at said point in the line of direction of the force (or moment).\"\nCastigliano’s Second Theorem: \\\\(\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F}}=\\Delta\\\\)\nFrom these theorems, these equations are rearrangements of our expressions for work/energy: \\\\(W=F\\Delta\\\\) or \\\\(W=M\\theta\\\\).\nThe main difference is that strain energy \\\\(U\\\\) must be a multi-variable function with applied loads and position \\\\(x\\\\) as variables. Then, we use partial derivatives to derive relationships between two variables.\nThese theorems have two constraints: \n1.  The structures are in the elastic region - stress and strain follow a [linear relationship](/tree-posts/linear-and-nonlinear-analysis). \n2.  [Environmental conditions](/tree-posts/what-are-the-types-of-structural-loads) are neglected, such as the movement of supports or changes in temperature.\nWe are only interested in the second theorem for our topic in structural deflections.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Deriving Castigliano's Second Theorem\nTo show how the second theorem was derived, we consider a [beam](/tree-posts/what-is-a-beam) loaded with three different [forces](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-loads): \\\\(F\\_1\\\\), \\\\(F\\_2\\\\), and \\\\(F\\_3\\\\) applied at \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) respectively. Also shown in the figure are the corresponding vertical deflections \\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\\\), \\\\(\\Delta\\_{B\\_v}\\\\) and  \\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\\\). Say we're interested in finding the vertical deflection at point \\\\(A\\\\).\n![Beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/65745f0c575373ec2f22c90f_WTS-8-Deflections_PartialDerivativeMethod-001.png)\nTo adequately explain this method, we represent the deflection at \\\\(A\\\\) with a placeholder force. It is something we will use temporarily for the unknown.\nThen, we need to observe the behavior of the beam under two loading sequences: (1) we apply the actual structural loads first, then the said placeholder load, and (2) we apply the placeholder load first, then apply the actual structural loads.\nWe assume the application of loads was gradual. In that way, the beam still behaves in the [elastic](/tree-posts/linear-and-nonlinear-analysis) range.\n### First Loading Sequence\n![First loading sequence](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a761edf92759cccd58c3_WTS-Structure_31.002-2.png)\nLet's start with the first loading sequence. We're interested in observing the beam's total [strain energy](/tree-posts/introduction-to-work-methods) \\\\(U\\\\) in this sequence. \nWhen the actual loads act on it, there is external work \\\\(W\\\\). From energy conservation, the structure will store a strain energy \\\\(U\\\\) equal to \\\\(W\\\\). We can graph these using a \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram.\nAt this point, the strain energy \\\\(U\\_T\\\\) of the whole system is:\n\\\\(U\\_T=U\\\\)\nLet's move on and apply a small force \\\\(dF\\_1\\\\) at point \\\\(A\\\\). This additional load will cause an increment in external work and also strain energy \\\\(U\\_{add}\\\\). Again, its purpose is to act as a placeholder for the deflection component we want to investigate.\n\\\\(U\\_{add}=\\Delta\\_{add}\\times{dF\\_1}=\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F\\_1}}dF\\_1\\\\)\nIn the previous expression, we expressed the additional deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\_{add}\\\\) in terms of its partial derivative. Remember, deflection is dependent on both force and strain energy: \\\\(U=F\\times\\Delta\\\\) or \\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{U}{F}\\\\). In this case, we express it as dependent on the placeholder force \\\\(dF\\_1\\\\).\nAs a result, the total \\\\(U\\_T\\\\) in this system is now:\n\\\\(U\\_T=U+U\\_{add}\\\\)\nEquation 1: \\\\(U\\_T=U+\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F\\_1}}dF\\_1\\\\)\n### Second Loading Sequence\nLet's reverse the sequence of loads seen in the following figure. In this sequence, we will investigate the external work on the beam system.\nWe apply the placeholder load \\\\(dF\\_1\\\\) first before \\\\(F\\_1\\\\), \\\\(F\\_2\\\\), and \\\\(F\\_3\\\\).\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a7769178cb47033a64cf_WTS-Structure_31.002-3.png)\nAt the first stage, the small force will create translation \\\\(\\delta\\_{A\\_v}\\\\). At this point, there is work \\\\(W\\\\) due to \\\\(dF\\_1\\\\); The total work \\\\(W\\_T\\\\) at this stage is:\n\\\\(W\\_T=dF\\_1{\\delta\\_{A\\_v}}\\\\)\nLet's move on to the next stage. We place the structural forces \\\\(F\\_1\\\\), \\\\(F\\_2\\\\), and \\\\(F\\_3\\\\) on the beam. As a result, the beam's deflection will be more prevalent than when the diminutive placeholder force is only applied. It results in additional work \\\\(W\\_{add}\\\\) due to \\\\(F\\_1\\\\), \\\\(F\\_2\\\\), and \\\\(F\\_3\\\\).\nThe entire work of the system is now:\nEquation 2: \\\\(W\\_T=dF\\_1\\delta\\_v+W\\_{add}\\\\)\n## Key Idea: General Partial Derivative Equation\nWe're ready to move on after analyzing both sequences. One important thing to note is that we should still arrive at the same beam behavior no matter what loading sequence we use. It implies that the first loading sequence is the same as the second one. As a result, we can equate Equations 1 and 2:\n\\\\(dF\\_1\\delta\\_v+W\\_{add}=U+\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F\\_1}}dF\\_1\\\\)\nBecause we've applied the same actual loading conditions for both sequences, both \\\\(W\\_{add}\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\) are equal; hence, we have the following:\n\\\\(dF\\_1\\delta\\_v+\\cancel{W\\_{add}}=\\cancel{U}+\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F\\_1}}dF\\_1\\\\)\n\\\\(\\delta\\_v=\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F\\_1}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\delta\\\\) or \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is the deflection we want to investigate.\n-   \\\\(U\\\\) is the strain energy of the structure.\n-   \\\\(F\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\) is the placeholder force or moment.\nThis equation is equal to the second theorem, as discussed earlier.\nWe will need to do two things to solve the deflection. First, introduce a placeholder force or moment representing the deflection we want to investigate. Second, we have to get the partial derivative of the strain energy to said placeholder force or moment.\n### Strain Energy\nLike the general work methods, solving for deflection will depend on the strain energy \\\\(U\\\\). This value would entirely depend on the primary stress the structure is experiencing, whether [flexural](/tree-posts/deriving-partial-derivative-method-due-to-flexural-strains), [axial](/tree-posts/deriving-partial-derivative-method-due-to-axial-strains), or torsional.\n## It Expands the Real Work Method\nThe second theorem is another approach to finding deflections using [real work](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-real-work). What makes this different from the latter is that we can introduce a placeholder force (or moment) at the point where we would like to find the deflection. Meaning we can see the deflection at any position of the structure without relying on imaginary forces.\nThere is a parallelism between this method and [virtual work](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work) because we have to introduce placeholders to find the deflection. The unit-load process requires you to create a virtual structure for the placeholder unit load, while this method directly places the placeholder load at the actual structure.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Castigliano's second theorem makes it possible to use real work to solve for deflections.\n> It states that \"the partial derivative of the total strain energy U to a force (or moment) at a point is equal to the translation (or rotation) at said point in the line of direction of the force (or moment).\"\n> This theorem is only valid if the structure is observing elastic behavior and we neglect environmental effects.\n> Symbolically, it is equal to \\\\(\\delta\\_v=\\frac{\\partial{U}}{\\partial{F\\_1}}\\\\).\n> We will need to do two things to solve the deflection. First, introduce a placeholder force or moment representing the deflection we want to investigate. Second, we have to get the partial derivative of the strain energy to said placeholder force or moment.\n> Like the general work methods, solving for deflection will depend on the strain energy \\\\(U\\\\).\n",

From the [second theorem of the area moment method](/tree-posts/what-is-tangential-deviation), this grouping corresponds to the tangential deviation at \\\\(x\\\\) from the tangent at \\\\(A\\\\); hence, we can rewrite Equation 2 as:\nEquation 3: \\\\(M\\_x=R\\_{A^{\\prime}}(x)-t\\_{x/A}\\\\)\nEarlier, when we were verifying the [first theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-conjugate-shear), we solved for the reaction at \\\\(A^{\\prime}\\\\):\n\\\\(R\\_{A^{\\prime}}=\\frac{t\\_{B/A}}{L}\\\\)\nSubstituting this to Equation 3, we have:\nEquation 4: \\\\(M\\_x=t\\_{B/A}\\left( \\frac{x}{L} \\right)-t\\_{x/A}\\\\)\nEquations 1 and 4 are the same.

If we look at the general expression, the denominator \\\\(f^{\\prime}(x)\\\\) cannot be zero (division by zero is impossible).\n-   After performing multiple iterations, the computed values diverge from each other (doesn't meet on a singular point).\n## Example\nSay we want to find the zeroes of \\\\(x^2+2x-4=0\\\\). From the degree of the polynomial function, there would be two zeroes.\nTo start, we need to assume a zero value of the function. We begin with \\\\(x=2\\\\) and perform the above steps.

There are four of these: the circle, parabola, ellipse, and the hyperbola. \nThese geometric shapes have countless applications – to describe projectile motion, to explain how planets move, to design roads and highways, to build structures, and more.\n## The Double-Napped Cone\n![The double-napped cone](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e357dbb6ca2e2e174b27de_WTS-1-Mathematics_ConicSections-1.png)\nLet's ask, \"Why are they called conic sections?\"\nConsider a double-napped cone in space. Let's pass a plane through this cone at various angles and get the intersecting section between the two:\n-   If we pass the plane parallel to the base of a cone, then the intersection is a circle.\n-   If we pass the plane parallel to the slant of a cone, it is a [parabola](/tree-posts/parabola).\n-   If we pass the plane at any angle (other than those described in a circle or parabola) through one cone, it is an [ellipse](/tree-posts/ellipse).\n-   If we pass the plane vertically through the two cones, it is a [hyperbola](/tree-posts/hyperbola).\nFrom this demonstration, we can say that these shapes are conic sections because we can construct it by passing sections through this double-napped cone.\n![The different conic sections](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e357f7ebc0da86795f741d_WTS-1-Mathematics_ConicSections-2.png)\nAlgebraically speaking, all of these sections have the general form:\n\\\\(A x^2+B x y+C y^2+D x+E y+F=0\\\\)\n-   \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\), and \\\\(F\\\\) are constants\n-   \\\\(x\\\\) is an independent variable\n-   \\\\(y\\\\) is a dependent variable\nSuppose we pass the plane through the meeting point of the two cones; what is the resulting section?

For example:\n-   A circle is a curve in which it is a collection of points that obeys a condition: equidistant to a fixed point we call the center.\nIn the following posts, we'll explore more of this locus-based definition of the different conic sections.\n## Summary\n> There are four conic sections: the circle, parabola, ellipse, and the hyperbola.\n> We can derive these sections from the double-napped cone.\n> All of these sections have the general form: \\\\(A x^2+B x y+C y^2+D x+E y+F=0\\\\)\n> We can describe conic sections as a locus – a set of all points obeying a condition.\n",

In our example, it occurs between points \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\).\nLike we did with the [point of zero shear](/tree-posts/what-is-the-point-of-zero-shear), we apply algebra: formulate the moment function for segment \\\\(CD\\\\), substitute \\\\(M\\_{CD}=0\\\\), and solve for \\\\(x\\\\):\n\\\\(M\\_{CD}=-18 x^2+222.75 x-407.25\\\\)\n\\\\(0=-18 x^2+222.75 x-407.25\\\\)\nSince this is a [quadratic function](/tree-posts/what-are-polynomial-functions), we can apply the quadratic formula:\n\\\\(x=\\frac{-(222.75) \\pm \\sqrt{(222.75)^2-4 (-18) (-407.25)}}{2 (-18)}\\\\)\n\\\\(x=10.15\\\\)\nThe point of zero moment is at a distance \\\\(10.15m\\\\) from the origin at \\\\(A\\\\).\n",

For example, a steel beam might work if this member supports a floor.\n## Material Properties\n### Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Materials\n![Homogeneous and heterogeneous: position and scale](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e56023121600d332b9df4_WTS-Structure_8-1.png)\nHomogeneous and heterogeneous have something to do with \"how consistent something is.\" When someone says the former_,_ its properties are uniform throughout; otherwise, it is the latter_._\nThis property **depends on the position**. Let's look at a steel beam. \nWhen we analyze any point, we expect it to look the same greyish metal. We can say it is homogeneous.\nOn a side note, this property **depends on scale**. Let's go back to our steel beam example. \nIf we investigate its microstructure, one may find flaky fragments, such as iron and carbon; At this scale, steel is heterogeneous.\n### Anisotropic and Isotropic Materials\n![Difference between isotropic and anisotropic materials](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e560ac0355a2502c5e8ac_WTS-Structure_8-2.png)\nScientists have discovered that properties **depend on direction**. When properties change along a path, it is anisotropic. On the other hand, when properties remain the same, it is isotropic. Let's look at examples:\nA great example of the former is wood. Its strength _perpendicular_ to the grain differs from its strength _parallel_ to it. On a side note, wood is also orthotropic - the properties change when analyzed along orthogonal axes.\nFor the latter, steel is a good example. The strength is the same no matter what direction we analyze.\nIt is important to note that this property also **depends on scale**.\n### Composite Materials\n![Difference between non-composite and composite materials](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e5613e1ddf3090d16cd79_WTS-Structure_8-3.png)\nWe can combine objects of different substances to form composites. For these materials, properties change. Generally, we do this for several reasons, such as to increase strength and stiffness.\n## Summary\n> Materials such as metals, wood, concrete, and plastics make a structure.\n> Homogeneous are those whose properties are the same at any point while heterogeneous are those that vary. It will depend on position and scale.\n> Anisotropic are those whose properties change in path. Isotropic are those that stay the same. These properties will depend on scale.\n> Composite materials occur when two or more materials act together.\n",

If you put the sun's image on top of the mountain image, you'll get a new picture with both the mountain and the sun. If you've worked with creative software, this is similar to layering.\nLikewise, structures behave that way. One similar model _added_ to another one will give you a new structure! That is the idea of superposition. Based on that, it implies the following possibilities:\n-   We can add [reactions, internal forces, and deflection](/tree-posts/introduction-to-structural-analysis) of similar structures with different loading conditions to get a new structure with combined effects.\n-   Break down an existing structure into similar ones that we can combine again. We can analyze these independent structures by themselves.\nIn summary, superposition tells us that the effect of one point in a structure due to various loads acting on it is the sum when these loads work separately. It is a powerful concept in structural analysis. Later in this course, we'll see how we can use it to analyze complex trusses, deflections, and indeterminate structures.\nIt is also essential to take note that structures must be similar. Superposition works if the structures are identical in type, geometry, shape, and rigidity at corresponding points. In addition, superposition only works if models behave linearly.\n### Example\n![Example of superposition](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea5b6ff16c8066e99f753_WTS-Structure_19.3-1.png)\nTo best explain this concept, let's investigate two [beams](/tree-posts/what-is-a-beam). These structures have the same [longitudinal](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-longitudinally) and [cross-sectional](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) properties ([flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) is assumed to be \\\\(1\\times{10}^{12}\\\\) for illustration purposes).

In that case, you'll arrive at a third beam similar in length \\\\(L\\\\) and material properties \\\\((E, I)\\\\) of the last two beams; As a consequence, the effects of the third beam should be the same if you are to analyze it by itself.\n#### Beam C - Superimposed Beam\n‍\nFor example, let's add the shear at the right end of these two beams, which are \\\\(-2.50 kN\\\\) and \\\\(-18.8 kN\\\\), respectively. With superposition, the shear at the right end \\\\(V\\\\) of the third beam is equal to \\\\(-21.25 kN\\\\).

      "Free Content": "Typically in ideal free-fall motion, we study an object's movement with [air resistance](/tree-posts/what-is-fluid-resistance) neglected. It means the body encounters no friction while it falls – like a body falling in a vacuum.\nIn real life, most objects will have some fluid resistance force that counteracts the motion of an object. This post explores that phenomenon.\n## Modeling Free Fall Motion with Air Resistance\nLet's begin by setting up the situation – [an object falls into Earth's atmosphere due to gravity](/tree-posts/what-is-gravitational-force). While it is dropping, air resistance counters its motion. We want to model the movement of the object due to these factors.\nWe describe its motion with the three critical motion variables against time \\\\(t\\\\) from a frame reference: position \\\\(s\\\\), velocity \\\\(v\\\\), and acceleration \\\\(a\\\\). \nAt the end of this post, we'll have three different models to describe the body's motion: \n-   \\\\(s-t\\\\), position-time\n-   \\\\(v-t\\\\), velocity-time\n-   \\\\(a-t\\\\), acceleration-time\n## Setting-Up The Model\n![Free falling object with fluid resistance](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e3636d913ef32e3399c47b_WTS-1-Physics_FreeFallFluidResistance-1.png)\nLet's study the object's kinetics and use Newton's Second Law of Motion. Using its elementary definition, the acceleration \\\\(a\\\\) of an object is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force \\\\(F\\_n\\\\) and inversely proportional to the mass \\\\(m\\\\):\n\\\\(a=\\frac{F\\_n}{m}=\\frac{\\sum F\\_y}{m} \\Longrightarrow \\sum F\\_y=m a\\\\)\nWe identify the forces acting on a small falling object of mass \\\\(m\\\\). \n1.  The force mainly responsible for the fall, the [gravitational force](/tree-posts/what-is-gravitational-force) between the falling object and Earth, \\\\(F\\_g\\\\) (or weight)\n2.  The force resisting the motion, which is fluid resistance \\\\(F\\_f\\\\)\nConsequently, Newton's second law would then result in the following equation:\n-   \\\\(\\left.\\sum F\\_y=m a\\right] \\uparrow\\_{+}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(F\\_f+\\left(-F\\_g\\right)=m a\\\\)\n-   \\\\(F\\_f-F\\_g=m a\\\\)\nGoing sidetrack for sign convention, we follow the grid defined in the figure: \n-   The fluid resistance is positive because it goes upwards, while the gravitational force is negative because it goes downwards. \n-   In other references, the direction of the positive sense for free fall motion is downwards (hence, the gravitational force is positive while the resistance is negative). \nWe can choose whatever sign convention as long as it's clearly defined.\nNow that we know the different factors affecting our model, we proceed to derive to find these models: \\\\(v-t\\\\), \\\\(a-t\\\\), and \\\\(s-t\\\\). To start, we recall that:\n-   \\\\(F\\_f-F\\_g=m a\\\\)\n-   \\\\(F\\_f-m g=m a\\\\)\nAt this point, we can express fluid resistance in two ways.

The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\n## Main Solution\nThe following is a general outline of how to use moment-by-cantilever parts:\n### Strategically Cut the Beam Into Parts\n![Placing the section at point C](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64560e110a7247034f5747b1_WTS-Structure_23.03-1.png)\nThe first step is to cut the beam into two parts - the left and right sections. For this example, say we cut it at point \\\\(C\\\\). We'll discuss soon why we put it at \\\\(C\\\\).\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Cantilever Parts\nAfter dividing the beam into two parts, we _isolate_ each loading condition in each section.\nFor section \\\\(ABC\\\\), there are three loading conditions; hence, we break down this section into three cantilever beams with the following loads:\n1.  \\\\(27kN•m\\\\) clockwise couple at \\\\(A\\\\)\n2.  \\\\(90kN\\\\) upward reaction at \\\\(B\\\\)\n3.  \\\\(0\\rightarrow{45kN/m}\\\\) downward uniform varying load between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\)\nFor section \\\\(CDE\\\\), there are also three loading conditions; hence, we break down this section into three cantilever beams with the following loads:\n1.  \\\\(36kN/m\\\\) downward uniform distributed load between \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\)\n2.  \\\\(263.25kN\\\\) upward reaction at \\\\(D\\\\)\n3.  \\\\(90kN\\\\) downward point load at \\\\(E\\\\)\nWith six cantilever beams, we create the moment diagram for each using [cantilever beam patterns](/tree-posts/how-to-get-the-area-and-centroid-of-cantilever-moment-diagrams-easily). As a result, we have the following graphs:\n![Drawing the moment diagrams of each cantilever part](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64560e25ba466a3c5ab9cbfe_WTS-Structure_23.03-2.png)\n### Superimpose Each Part\nAfter drawing the moment diagrams for each part, we combine all of these graphs into one single graph:\n![Superimposing all individual moment diagrams](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64560e32b609a66a368b695d_WTS-Structure_23.03-3.png)\n‍\nThis graph is the moment diagram of the beam after superimposing all moment diagrams. The benefit of this moment-by-parts diagram is that it makes it easy for us to compute the [area and centroids](/tree-posts/how-to-get-the-area-and-centroid-of-cantilever-moment-diagrams-easily) of each part - something we would need when calculating the beam's deflection.\n## Traditional Moment Diagram and Superimposed Moment Diagram\nYou might be thinking: \"how is this moment diagram the same as when we create moment diagrams using equations?\"\nLook at the moment-by-parts diagram and consider the moment values at \\\\(C\\\\). If we add all the moments at this location (on either side):\n\\\\(\\sum M\\_{C\\_L}=27+405-151.875=280.125\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum M\\_{C\\_R}=-364.5+1184.625-540=280.125\\\\)\nThis superimposed value is the same as if we find the moment at \\\\(C\\\\) using the corresponding moment equation:\n\\\\(M\\_{B C}=-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-139 \\frac{2}{3}\\\\{2 \\leq x \\leq 6.5\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{B C}=-\\frac{5}{3} (6.5)^3+10 (6.5)^2+70 (6.5)-139 \\frac{2}{3}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{B C}=280.125\\\\)\nThis equality implies that if you add the corresponding moment values in the parts diagram, you will eventually arrive at the moment graph made using equations.\n## Why There?\nLet's go back to why we chose point \\\\(C\\\\) as the location of the cutting plane. In actuality, we can select any location to place it; however, we are taking advantage of the [cantilever beam patterns](/tree-posts/how-to-get-the-area-and-centroid-of-cantilever-moment-diagrams-easily) for an easy solution. So, we need to keep these points in mind when choosing a place:\n-   We need to mimic the loading conditions of the cantilever beam patterns. If, for instance, we place it somewhere between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), we will complicate the loading conditions on the right side of the beam.\n-   We should minimize the number of loading conditions to break down when making cantilever parts. Again, if we place it between \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), the number of cantilever beams on the right side may require more than three.\n-   The goal of the moment-by-parts diagram is to make it easy for us to compute the area and centroid of the moment graph (which we will need in specific topics). The patterns help us in this case. Hence, we should place it so that the resulting diagram would be easy to compute for its area and centroid.\n",

      "Free Content": "This post explains the artificial constraints of the [conjugate beam method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-conjugate-beam-method).\n## Artificial Constraints\nWith both theorems discussed, it is more evident that the conjugate beam method is an analogy of beam analysis and an expansion of the area moment method. One advantage compared to area moment is that we don't need to draw the deflected shape to derive relationships.\nHowever, one problem with using this method is that it obscures the theory behind the analogy.\nTo illustrate, let's consider [cantilever beam](/tree-posts/analyzing-the-cantilever-beam) \\\\(AB\\\\) as shown:\n![Introduction to artificial constraints](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a25ca9194f770a70fbe2_WTS-Structure_30.3-1.png)\nSay that we are to solve the deflection of this beam at the [fixed and free ends](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) using this method. From inspection, we know that:\n-   The rotation and translation must be zero at the fixed end \\\\(A\\\\).\n-   The rotation and translation must not equal zero at the free end \\\\(B\\\\).\nNow, let's construct the conjugate beam with the same support conditions (fixed end at \\\\(A^{\\prime}\\\\) and free end at \\\\(B^{\\prime}\\\\)). Just by viewing it, we know the following:\n-   Since \\\\(A^{\\prime}\\\\) is a fixed-end support, the shear and moment at \\\\(A^{\\prime}\\\\) must not be zero.\n-   Since \\\\(B^{\\prime}\\\\) is a free end, the shear and moment must be zero.\nFrom Theorems 1 and 2 of the conjugate beam method, you can see that there is a contradiction between the actual and conjugate structures.\nFor these types of beams, we have to change the support conditions of the conjugate beam to match the deflections of the actual beam. With this, you can use the [first](/tree-posts/what-is-conjugate-shear) and [second](/tree-posts/what-is-conjugate-moment) theorems of the conjugate beam method without the contradiction we encountered.\nThese changes in support are what we call artificial constraints of the conjugate beam. For simple beams, we don't need to apply such. Common examples that we need to change supports are [cantilever beams, restrained beams, overhanging beams, and beams with interior supports](/tree-posts/what-are-common-beam-types).\nThe following illustration shows the conditions we must apply when creating the conjugate beam.\n![Equivalent artificial constraints of real supports](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a2753f03ef5199b56b8d_WTS-Structure_30.3-2.png)\n-   We must change the fixed end of the real beam to a free one.\n-   We must change the free end of the real beam to a fixed one.\n-   We must change the simple interior supports of a real beam to an internal hinge.\n-   Simple exterior supports remain the same.\n## ‍Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> In constructing conjugate beams, we must change the supports of the actual beam to match the deflection behavior. These supports of the conjugate beam are what we call artificial constraints.\n> The rules of artificial constraints are simple: (1) we must change the fixed end of the real beam to a free one, (2) we must change the free end of the real beam to a fixed one, (3) we must change the simple interior supports of a real beam to an internal hinge. and (4) simple exterior supports remain the same.\n",

      "Free Content": "We'll explore this most basic [analytical procedure](/tree-posts/solving-differential-equations-analytically) of solving differential equations (DE): the separation of variables.\n## Separation of Variables\n![Separation of variables](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35fb0ded28278e7746d87_WTS-1-Mathematics_SeparationOfVariables-1.png)\nThe separation of variables is the simplest method of [finding solutions to a DE](/tree-posts/solving-differential-equations). It only works if the differential equation has the form: \\\\(M(x) + N(y)y^\\prime = 0\\\\), where:\n-   \\\\(M(x)\\\\) is a function of \\\\(x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(N(y)\\\\) is a function of \\\\(y\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\) or \\\\(y^\\prime\\\\) is the [first derivative](/tree-posts/what-is-the-first-derivative) of \\\\(N(y)\\\\)\nWe can summarize the concept of this method using these steps:\n-   First, arrange all variables and differentials related to \\\\(x\\\\) on one side of the equation and those about \\\\(y\\\\) on the other. We can do this by transposing constants, variables, and differentials.\n-   After separating, integrate both sides of the equation to remove the differential; You'll end up with the solution to the DE.\n## Example\nConsider the differential equation \\\\(y^\\prime = \\frac{3x^2}{2y}\\\\). Let's find the general solution to this DE:\n### Investigate DE\nFirst, we investigate if the DE observes the form, \\\\(M(x) + N(y)y^\\prime = 0\\\\). \nLet's transpose the terms in our DE and try to match the form:\n-   \\\\(y^\\prime = \\frac{3x^2}{2y}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(2y \\cdot y^\\prime = 3x^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(3x^2 - 2y \\cdot y^\\prime = 0\\\\)\nIn this rearranged form:\n-   \\\\(M(x)\\\\) is \\\\(3x^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(N(y)\\\\) is \\\\(2y\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y^\\prime\\\\) is \\\\(y^\\prime\\\\)\nIt observes the general form; hence, our DE obeys the condition.\nWe can directly check if it obeys the form if we can separate the x-terms on one side and the y-terms on the other.\n### Apply Method\nIf the DE observes the form, we can use the separation of variables. Separate the variable \\\\(x\\\\) at one side of the equation and the variable \\\\(y\\\\):\n-   \\\\(y^\\prime = \\frac{3x^2}{2y}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{3x^2}{2y}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(2ydy = 3x^2dx\\\\)\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation to eliminate the differentials.\n-   \\\\(\\int 2ydy = \\int 3x^2dx\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{2 y^2}{2}=\\frac{3 x^3}{3}+C\\_1\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y^2=x^3+C\\_1\\\\)\nThe expression \\\\(y^2=x^3+C\\_1\\\\) is the general solution to the DE. To check your answer, substitute the solution and its derivatives to the original DE and determine if it satisfies the equation.\nIf there are conditions in the problem, we can expand our general solution to a particular one.\n### Constant of Integration\nA thing of importance when it comes to integrating DE is the constant of integration \\\\(C\\\\). Ideally, you should include \\\\(C\\\\) every time you perform an indefinite integration. Since we performed two integrations, one on the left and another on the right side of the equation, we should have two constants on both sides; why do we have only one?\nSupposedly we put two constants of integration. We let \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) be these constants on both sides, respectively. If we transpose both constants to one side, we'll combine their values \\\\(A+B\\\\). We represent this sum as \\\\(C\\\\). The constant of integration in a DE is already the combined value from both sides of the equation.\n## Summary\n> The separation of variables is the simplest method of finding solutions to a DE. \n> It only works if the differential equation has the form: \\\\(M(x) + N(y)y^\\prime = 0\\\\), where: \\\\(M(x)\\\\) is a function of \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(N(y)\\\\) is a function of \\\\(y\\\\), and \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\), \\\\(y^\\prime\\\\) is the first derivative of \\\\(N(y)\\\\)\n> First, arrange all variables and differentials related to \\\\(x\\\\) on one side of the equation and those about \\\\(y\\\\) on the other.

Afterward, we perform a simple test:\n-   If the shear changed from positive to negative or vice versa between its endpoints, then a point of zero shear occurred.\n-   If the shear remains the same (positive to positive or negative to negative) for both endpoints, there is no point of zero shear.\nIn our example, there is a change from positive to negative when analyzing the shear at segment \\\\(BC\\\\):\n\\\\(V\\_B=90kN\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_C=-11.25kN\\\\) \nThese results mean that there is a point of zero shear between these two points \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\).\n### Point of Zero Shear\nThe point of zero shear is where the maximum moment will occur.

We want to answer the question: \"where in between these two points is the location of zero shear?\"\nTo answer that, we apply algebra.

We have a simple beam with length \\\\(L\\\\) loaded with uniformly distributed load \\\\(w\\\\). In addition, we draw its deflected shape with deviation \\\\(t\\_{B/A}\\\\).\nSuppose that we are interested in finding the rotation at \\\\(A\\\\). From the beam's deflected shape, we can say it is:\nEquation 1: \\\\(\\theta\\_A=\\frac{t\\_{B/A}}{L}\\\\)\nBelow the actual beam is the fictional loading \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\) of the conjugate beam. For this example, we use [moment by parts](/tree-posts/what-is-moment-by-parts) (with a section cut at \\\\(B\\\\)) to compute its area and centroid later on efficiently.\nLet's compute for the shear at the left end \\\\(A^{\\prime}\\\\) - the parallel point of \\\\(A\\\\) in the real beam.

We will only need to modify two things in the approximate solution: \n-   The area of the band (frustum) must be so small that we represent it with a differential \\\\(dA\\\\)\n-   We need an operation that will sum up all of these tiny divisions\nWe can combine all \\\\(dA\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the surface area \\\\(S\\\\), between two points along the function is:\n\\\\(S=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dA}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(S\\\\) is the surface area\n-   \\\\(dA\\\\) is the differential area\n-   \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value)\n-   \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\n### Differential Frustum\n![The differential frustum](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e3620aded28278e7772717_WTS-1-Mathematics_SurfaceArea-3.png)\nThe differential frustum \\\\(dA\\\\) is the division we use to sum all areas along the solid's surface. It results from having a differential slant length \\\\(dL\\\\). From its elementary formula, we can express it as:\n\\\\(S=2 \\pi \\int\\_{a}^{b} r(x) \\cdot  dL\\\\)\n-   \\\\(S\\\\) is the surface area\n-   \\\\(\\pi\\\\) is mathematical constant pi\n-   \\\\(r(x)\\\\) is the average radius expressed as a function\n-   \\\\(dL\\\\) is the differential length\n-   \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value)\n-   \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\nWe can also think of the radius function \\\\(r(x)\\\\) as the slant boundary of the solid. Since we have a differential frustum, we can express it directly as it is and not the average of its top and base radii (unlike in Elementary geometry).\n#### Differential Slant Length\nTo get the differential slant length \\\\(dL\\\\), we form a right triangle with its differential legs \\\\(dx\\\\) and \\\\(dy\\\\). We can isolate \\\\(dL\\\\), similar to getting the [arc of a curve using integration](/tree-posts/how-to-find-the-arc-of-a-curve-using-integration). As a result, \\\\(dL\\\\) can either be:\n-   Along x: \\\\(d L=\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^2} dx\\\\)\n-   Along y: \\\\(d L=\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d x}{d y}\\right)^2} dy\\\\)\nFrom this, the frustum element's differential slant length \\\\(dL\\\\) will vary depending on the orientation.\nSince there are two forms, the radius function \\\\(r(x)\\\\) must correspond properly to \\\\(dL\\\\). It must be in terms of the differential variable:\n-   If the radius function is in terms of \\\\(x\\\\), we use \\\\(d L=\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^2} dx\\\\)\n-   If the radius function is in terms of \\\\(y\\\\), we use \\\\(d L=\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d x}{d y}\\right)^2} dy\\\\)\nAs a result, there are two specific expressions for the surface area:\n\\\\(S=2 \\pi \\int\\_{a}^{b} r(x) \\cdot \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^2} dx\\\\)\n\\\\(S=2 \\pi \\int\\_{a}^{b} r(y) \\cdot \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{d x}{d y}\\right)^2} dy\\\\)\n## Summary\n> Solving the surface area of a solid of revolution by integration expands on the approximation solution.\n> The logic is to subdivide the area needed with frustum bands, solve for the surface area of each part, and add all of these areas.\n> It is necessary to keep the surface area small to increase the accuracy of the solution; hence, we must represent the parts as the differential \\\\(dA\\\\).\n> We can combine all \\\\(dA\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the surface area between two points: \\\\(S=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dA}\\\\)\n> The differential frustum \\\\(dA\\\\) is the division we use to sum all areas along the solid's surface: \\\\(S=2 \\pi \\int\\_{a}^{b} r(x) \\cdot d L\\\\). \\\\(S\\\\) is the surface area, \\\\(\\pi\\\\) is mathematical constant pi, \\\\(r(x)\\\\) is the average radius expressed as a function, \\\\(dL\\\\) is the differential length, \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value), \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\n> Two ways exist to express the differential slant length \\\\(dL\\\\). It is similar to getting the arc length of a curve using integration.\n> In terms along the x-axis, \\\\(S\\\\) is equal to: \\\\(S=2 \\pi \\int\\_{a}^{b} r(x) \\cdot \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} dx\\\\)\n> In terms along the y-axis, \\\\(S\\\\) is equal to: \\\\(S=2 \\pi \\int\\_{a}^{b} r(y) \\cdot \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dx}{dy}\\right)^2} dy\\\\)\n",

      "Free Content": "In this post, we'll learn how to solve homogeneous differential equations (DE):\n## What is a Homogeneous Function?\nTo properly understand homogeneous DEs, we'll first start by defining what homogeneous functions are.\nSay we have a [function](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and a random variable \\\\(t\\\\). Let's evaluate it with \\\\(x = tx\\\\) and \\\\(y = ty\\\\). The function \\\\(f\\\\) would then be \\\\(f(tx, ty)\\\\). If this expression is the same as \\\\(t^n \\cdot f(tx, ty)\\\\), then we say that function \\\\(f\\\\) is homogeneous.\nTo illustrate, let's look at \\\\(f(x,y) = 3xy + 5x^2\\\\). We can check if the function is homogeneous:\nFirst, let \\\\(x = tx\\\\) and \\\\(y = ty\\\\). Evaluate the expression using these values.\n-   \\\\(f(x,y) = 3xy + 5x^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(f(t x, t y)=3(t x)(t y)+5(t x)^2\\\\)\nNext, manipulate the function so that \\\\(t\\\\) can be factored out. Match the form \\\\(t^nf(x, y)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(f(t x, t y)=3 x y t^2+5 x^2 t^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(f(t x, t y)=t^2\\left(3 x y+5 x^2\\right)\\\\)\nThe function is homogeneous if we reach the form \\\\(t^nf(x, y)\\\\). In the example, \\\\(t^nf(x, y)=t^2\\left(3 x y+5 x^2\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\) where \\\\(n\\\\) is 2. This value, 2, is the degree of the homogeneous function.\n## Homogeneous Differential Equations\nIf we have a [DE](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation) of the form: \\\\(M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0\\\\) and the functions \\\\(M(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(N(x, y)\\\\) are homogeneous with the same degree, then we have a homogeneous differential equation.\nWhen we have a homogeneous DE, we can convert the form into one that is solvable using [separation of variables](/tree-posts/what-is-separation-of-variables). We can summarize the concept of this method using these steps:\n-   We create a placeholder expression relating \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) with a random variable.\n-   Substitute the placeholder expression to the homogeneous DE, replacing either \\\\(x\\\\) or \\\\(y\\\\).\n-   Solve the DE with the random variable using separation of variables.\n-   Return the replaced \\\\(x\\\\) or \\\\(y\\\\) using the placeholder expression.\n## Example\nConsider the differential equation: \\\\(xydx + 2x^2dy = 0\\\\). Let's try to solve it.\n### Investigate DE\nFirst, we would investigate if this DE observes the form: \\\\(M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0\\\\). Let's identify the components of the equation:\n-   \\\\(M(x, y) = xy\\\\)\n-   \\\\(N(x, y) = 2x^2\\\\)\nWe then check if \\\\(M(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(N(x, y)\\\\) are homogeneous functions of the same degree:\n-   \\\\(M(x, y) = xy\\\\)\n-   \\\\(M(tx, ty) = (tx)(ty)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(M(tx, ty) = t^2(xy)\\\\)\n\\\\(M(x, y) = xy\\\\) is a homogeneous function of degree 2.\n-   \\\\(N(x, y) = 2x^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(N(tx, ty) = 2(tx)^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(N(tx, ty) = t^2(2x^2)\\\\)\n\\\\(N(x, y) = 2x^2\\\\) is a homogeneous function of degree 2.\nBecause both functions are of the same degree, we can use this method to solve the DE.\n### Apply Method\nTo begin the homogeneous DE solution, we relate \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) with another variable - let's say \\\\(a\\\\). We create a simple placeholder expression: \\\\(y = ax\\\\). In preparation for the later stage, we need to find the differential of this expression: \\\\(dy = adx + xda\\\\).\nAfterward, we substitute the placeholder expression and its derivatives into the DE.\n-   \\\\(xydx + 2x^2dy = 0\\\\)\n-   \\\\(x(a x) d x+2 x^2(a d x+x d a)=0\\\\)\nNext, we simplify the expression to reach a DE of the form \\\\(M(x) + N(y)y' = 0\\\\). To achieve this, we must divide the whole equation with a value common to all terms.\n-   \\\\(\\frac{x^2 a d x+2 x^2 a d x+2 x^3 d a=0}{x^2}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(a d x+2 a d x+2 x d a=0\\\\)\n-   \\\\(3 a d x+2 x d a=0\\\\)\nWe can apply separation of variables afterward to reach a solution. We won't show the process, but the general solution will be: \n-   \\\\(\\frac{3 d x}{x}=\\frac{-2 d a}{a}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(3\\ln(x) = -2\\ln(a) + C\\_1\\\\)\nFor solutions that involve logarithms, it's better to express them in algebraic terms. We can do this by letting \\\\(C\\_1\\\\) be \\\\(\\ln C\\\\) and applying logarithm rules to reach an expression free from it. We can do this since \\\\(C\\_1\\\\) is a constant expression encompassing a [family of different solutions](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation-solution).\n-   \\\\(3 \\ln (x)=-2 \\ln (a)+C\\_1\\\\)\n-   \\\\(3 \\ln (x)=-2 \\ln (a)+\\ln (C)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\ln (x)^3=\\ln (a)^{-2}+\\ln (C)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(e^{\\ln (x)^3=} e^{\\ln \\left(\\frac{C}{a^2}\\right)}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(x^3=\\frac{C}{a^2}\\\\)\nFrom the placeholder expression \\\\(a=y/x\\\\), we return the original variable \\\\(y\\\\) and simplify. \n-   \\\\(x^3=\\frac{C}{a^2}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(x^3=\\frac{C}{\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(x=\\frac{C}{y^2}\\\\)\nThe final result is the general solution. We can verify this by evaluating the original DE with the answer.\n## Summary\n> Homogeneous differential equations are another approach to solving differential equations analytically.\n> Say we have a function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and a random variable \\\\(t\\\\).

In a 2D structure, there are at most three per joint (rotation, horizontal translation, vertical translation). With five joints, we have a total of 15 components.\nFrom inspection, we can already solve the value of some components: \nSince no horizontal loads are acting on the beam that causes it to move along the x-axis, horizontal translation at all critical points is zero (5 inspected, ten remaining)\nVertical movement at supports is not allowed at \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\); hence, vertical translation at these points is also zero (7 inspected, eight remaining)\nFrom 15 components, we would need to solve only 8 using the area moment method.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Main Solution\n### Get M/EI of Beam\nThe first step is to create the moment diagram of the beam.

The solution is similar to [finding the \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) of a beam using equations or diagrams](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment); hence, if you're well-versed in the determinate analysis of beams, the following section is straightforward.\nOur conjugate beam is a compound beam with internal connections at \\\\(B^{\\prime}\\\\) and \\\\(D^{\\prime}\\\\); hence, we would need to create free body diagrams for each part: \\\\(A^{\\prime}B^{\\prime}\\\\), \\\\(B^{\\prime}D^{\\prime}\\\\), and \\\\(D^{\\prime}E^{\\prime}\\\\).\n#### Free Body Diagram B'D'\n![Free body diagram B'D'](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a2f03608851d4575f9f4_WTS-Structure_30.5-4.png)\nLet's investigate \\\\(B^{\\prime}D^{\\prime}\\\\).

When we add these two structures together, you'll get the bar forces for each complex truss.\n#### Convert to a Simple Truss\n![Convert complex truss example to simple truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432d032a50b9cbb53637c99_WTS-Structure_21.1-1.png)\nThe first step is to convert our complex truss into a [simple](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-trusses) one by removing any member, say \\\\(AD\\\\); however, in doing so, we made the truss unstable. To reverse that effect, we add another member, say \\\\(DG\\\\). There is no rule on what member to remove or add. Just remember that our goal here is to make our truss simple.\nWe load this simple truss with the supports and loads like that of our original complex truss. The result is a new structure with the same reactions and loads \\\\(S\\_p\\\\), serving as an element for the superposition process.\nLike any other simple truss, the next step is to thoroughly analyze the reactions and bar forces of this simple truss using the [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) or [sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections). It is up to the reader how to solve for such values.\nAt the end of the analysis, we will have the axial forces of each member summarised in the table shown. Remember that \\\\(AD\\\\) does not exist in this truss, and \\\\(DG\\\\) is a substitute member for stability purposes.\n",
      "Paid Content": "#### Create Proxy Truss\n![Create proxy truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432d03abbbc42e1dbf04545_WTS-Structure_21.1-2.png)\nThe next step is to create a proxy truss for the [superposition](/tree-posts/what-is-superposition) process \\\\(S\\_x\\\\). Remember that we could not solve for \\\\(AD\\\\) in the simple truss because we removed it; hence, to counteract that effect, we must create the same simple truss as Sp and represent \\\\(AD\\\\) with a tensile force \\\\(x\\\\).\nOur goal here is to represent all bar forces in terms of this variable \\\\(x\\\\) using either method of joints or section.\nLet's consider joint A and solve for the unknowns in terms of \\\\(x\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AB}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}x=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AB}=-0.447x\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AG}+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}x=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AG}=-0.894x\\\\)\nContinue doing this for all members. As shown in the table, we will get the forces in terms of \\\\(x\\\\) for all members.\n‍\nSign conventions for both \\\\(S\\_p\\\\) and \\\\(S\\_x\\\\) are critical, so double-check all signs before proceeding to the next part.\n#### Apply Superposition\n![Apply superposition to simple and proxy truss to solve for the complex truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432d0465c88a369333ce5b5_WTS-Structure_21.1-3.png)\nAt this point, we have completely solved the bar forces of both structures \\\\(S\\_p\\\\) and \\\\(S\\_x\\\\); hence, we are ready to apply the idea of superposition.\nRemember that we are solving for the bar forces of the complex truss \\\\(S\\_T\\\\). Equation-wise, it is:\n\\\\(S\\_T=S\\_p+S\\_x\\\\)\nWe first apply superposition to solve for \\\\(x\\\\). With it, we can solve the bar forces of the complex truss. To find for \\\\(x\\\\), let's take an interest in \\\\(DG\\\\), the substitute member added to the simple truss for stability purposes.\nWe know that \\\\(DG\\\\) does not exist in our truss example; hence, \\\\(S\\_T\\\\) for the substitute member must be zero:\n\\\\(S\\_T=S\\_p+S\\_x\\\\)\n\\\\(0=-100.96-0.40x\\\\)\n\\\\(x=-252.4kN=F\\_{AD}\\\\)\nWhen we solved for \\\\(x\\\\), we already got the axial force of the original member we removed which is \\\\(AD\\\\). With \\\\(x\\\\) solved, we can complete our analysis by performing superposition to all members.\n## Summarize Your Results\nAfter superimposing all bar forces, we have arrived at a complete solution! As one final step, it is always a good idea to summarise your results using a table. When summarizing, it's always great to [categorize](/tree-posts/what-are-the-parts-of-a-truss) your results for easy reference (top chords, bottom chords, and web members).\n‍\n",

      "Paid Content": "From our [previous post](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-the-partial-derivative-method), recall that we need an expression for the strain energy \\\\(U\\\\) to fit our general equation. We will focus first on strains due to flexural action.\nThis energy we need is familiar because we already have derived it in another [post](/tree-posts/deriving-real-work-due-to-flexural-strains). In our discussion with real work strain energy due to flexural strains, we recall that strain energy is:\n\\\\(U=\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\frac{M^2}{EI}dx\\\\)\nWe highly recommend reading the said post if we need a refresher.\n## Key Idea: Partial Derivative Method Due to Flexural Strains\nMoving on, with flexural strain energy derived, we can apply the general equation to it. As a result, we will obtain the following equations:\nPartial Derivative Method - Flexural Strains - Translation: \\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{F}}\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\frac{M^2}{EI}dx \\right]\\\\)\nPartial Derivative Method - Flexural Strains - Rotation: \\\\(\\theta=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{M\\_P}}\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\frac{M^2}{EI}dx \\right]\\\\)\nHere is the meaning of these variables:\n-   \\\\(F\\\\) or \\\\(M\\_P\\\\) refers to the placeholder loads.\n-   \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) or \\\\(\\theta\\\\) refers to the deflection component we would like to investigate.\n-   \\\\(M\\\\) refers to the bending moment due to the imposed loading and the placeholder.\n-   \\\\(EI\\\\) is [flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity).\nThese equations are what we use to solve for the translation and rotation of a structure.\n### Simplified Approach\nLet's move on and discuss how to evaluate the equations above. Generally, there are two ways:\n-   The first approach is to find an expression of strain energy \\\\(U\\\\) in terms of \\\\(P\\\\) (or \\\\(M\\\\)), then apply the equation.\n-   Another approach is to interchange the derivative and the integral. It is possible because these two are opposite operations. \nBetween these two, we recommend the second one. We first start with our first expression:\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{F}}\\left[ \\frac{M^2}{EI} \\right]dx\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{2}\\int2\\times\\frac{M}{EI}\\times\\frac{\\partial{M}}{\\partial{F}}dx\\\\)\nAs a result, we have the following expressions:\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\int\\frac{M}{EI}\\times\\frac{\\partial{M}}{\\partial{F}}dx\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta=\\int\\frac{M}{EI}\\times\\frac{\\partial{M}}{\\partial{M\\_P}}dx\\\\)\nThese equations are simpler to evaluate. Later, we shall use an example to demonstrate how to use these equations.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> The expression for the strain energy due to flexural strains is \\\\(U=\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\frac{M^2}{EI}dx\\\\).\n> The equations we will use to solve for the deflections are the following: (1) \\\\(\\Delta=\\int\\frac{M}{EI}\\times\\frac{\\partial{M}}{\\partial{F}}dx\\\\), and (2) \\\\(\\theta=\\int\\frac{M}{EI}\\times\\frac{\\partial{M}}{\\partial{M\\_P}}dx\\\\).\n",

We then take advantage of the Law of Conservation of Energy to solve for the deflections.\nOne massive benefit of the work methods is that they allow you to solve for the deflection of plane beams, frames, and trusses.\n## Preparation\nThis post serves as a preparation stage. We will need to understand several topics to understand the work methods.\n-   Work and Energy\n-   Law of Conservation of Energy\n-   Strain Energy\n-   Superposition\n## Work, Energy, and the Law of Conservation of Energy\n-   Work \\\\(W\\\\) happens if a force or moment causes something to move: \\\\(W=P{\\times}{\\Delta}\\\\) or \\\\(W=M{\\times}{\\theta}\\\\).\n-   Energy is the ability to do work.\n-   The Law of Conservation of Energy states that nothing can create or destroy energy.\nYou can learn more about these concepts in this [post](/tree-posts/reviewing-work-and-energy-in-structural-analysis).\n### Relating Work and Energy\nWork and energy can be related using the Law of Conservation of Energy. Concerning our topic of structural deflections, we'll consider a [beam](/tree-posts/what-is-a-beam) example.\n![External work and internal energy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a362ae5e394c771f64d5_WTS-Structure_31-1.png)\nWhen loads apply to it and cause [deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection), there is external work \\\\(W\\\\). From the law of conservation of energy, this external work \\\\(W\\\\) has to transfer somewhere. As the beam deflects from its original position, the fibers of the beam will deform and store the external work \\\\(W\\\\) in the form of strain energy \\\\(U\\\\). Generally speaking, we can express this law for this system as:\n\\\\(W=U\\\\)\n## Strain Energy\nLet's expound on strain energy \\\\(U\\\\). Formally, this is potential energy due to the deformation of an object.\nTo illustrate what it is, say that we have a fixed bar on one end, as seen in the figure. Initially, this bar is unstressed and experiences no form of load. When we apply a tension force \\\\(P\\\\) on the free end, the bar elongates by \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), and there is external work \\\\(W\\\\). It causes the bar to experience axial strains in the form of strain energy \\\\(U\\\\). When we remove tension force, the bar may or may not return to its original state depending on its properties.\nWith \\\\(U\\\\), the next question is: how do we compute strain energy \\\\(U\\\\)? The answer to that question will depend on the amount of \\\\(P\\\\) applied and the object's deformation.\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Elastic and Plastic Regions\nTo adequately explain, say that we are to gradually increase force \\\\(P\\\\) continually and plot the results using a force-displacement \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram:\n![Definition of strain energy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a37b6e54a90cb831663f_WTS-Structure_31-2.png)\nAt first, there is a direct [linear](/tree-posts/linear-and-nonlinear-analysis) relationship between \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), as evidenced by the straight line. During this phase, the material returns to its original unstressed state whenever we remove \\\\(P\\\\). In Strength of Materials, we say that the bar is at the elastic region.\nAs \\\\(P\\\\) continually increases, there comes the point where the deformations it experiences becomes permanent. Once we release \\\\(P\\\\) at this state, the bar will never return to its original unstressed state. At this point, we say that \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) observe a [nonlinear](/tree-posts/linear-and-nonlinear-analysis) relationship. We say the bar has reached the plastic region.\nBetween these two regions lies a point we call the yield point. It marks the transition between the two areas.\nBecause of these different regions, the answer to how to compute strain energy is not precisely direct. However, we can interpret it as the area under a \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) graph.\nIf the work applied causes the structure to deform in the elastic region, then the area under the \\\\(P-\\Delta\\\\) diagram is:\nStrain Energy - Elastic Region: \\\\(U=\\frac{1}{2}P\\Delta\\\\)\nThis expression is what we used to solve for strain energy \\\\(U\\\\) (if the object is still in the elastic region). It means you can only use it until the object has reached its yield point.\n## Superposition\n-   Superposition allows you to add reactions, internal forces, and deflection of similar structures with different loading conditions to get a combined similar model.\n-   Superposition can also _\"break down\"_ an existing structure into similar structures that can be combined again.\nYou can learn more about these concepts in this [post](/tree-posts/what-is-superposition).\n## Work Methods\nWe are now ready to discuss the different work methods for solving deflections of structures. There are two work or energy methods approaches (1) [Virtual Work](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work) and (2) [Real Work](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-real-work).\nThe second method, real work, is limited to certain instances, as we will discover soon. To break its limitations, there is the [Partial Derivative Method](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-the-partial-derivative-method).\nFrom these approaches, there is real work and fictional (virtual) work. To expound, recall that work is force \\\\(F\\\\) times displacement \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) or moment \\\\(M\\\\) times rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\). If both are real quantities, then it is real work. On the other hand, if any of those quantities is imaginary, then it is virtual work.\n## Summary\n> Virtual and real work methods are essential procedures in solving translations and rotations.\n> Also known as energy methods, we investigate the work or energy done by the structure rather than analyzing it in terms of its loads.\n> One massive benefit of the work methods is that they allow you to solve for the deflection of plane beams, frames, and trusses.\n> As preparation, we recall and introduce several concepts: work, energy, the Law of Conservation of Energy, strain energy, and superposition.\n> Work \\\\(W\\\\) happens if a force or moment causes something to move: \\\\(W=P{\\times}{\\Delta}\\\\) or \\\\(W=M{\\times}{\\theta}\\\\).\n> Energy is the ability to do work.\n> The Law of Conservation of Energy states that nothing can create or destroy energy.

These joints can resist both force and moment/torsion imposed on them. For example, if we rotate it by angle \\\\(\\theta\\\\), the angle between members should remain the same to maintain rigidity. For example, turning a 90º joint must still be a 90º joint after rotation. An excellent example is an ideal monolithic reinforced concrete beam and column connection.\n### Flexible (Pinned or Hinge)\nFlexible joints (or pinned/hinge joints) are the opposite of rigid joints in terms of rotation. These joints can resist forces but not moment/torsion. Going back to our example, if we rotate a 90º joint by an angle \\\\(\\theta\\\\), it doesn't need to be the same 90º after rotation. Pinned connections of ideal trusses are another excellent example of this connection.\n### Semi-Rigid\nA semi-rigid joint occurs when connections exhibit both properties from rigid and flexible connections. When a 90º joint rotates by an angle \\\\(\\theta\\\\), for example, it doesn't necessarily maintain a perfect 90º similar to hinged connections; however, it does offer some stiffness and resistance to rotation like rigid connections.\nMost structural joints, in real-life, are semi-rigid by nature; however, in analysis, we assume either a perfect rigid or flexible joint.\n## Summary\n> Joints or connections are specific points in a structure where members are connected.\n> Connections influence the structure's behavior.\n> There are three types of connections in terms of rigidity: (1) rigid, (2) flexible (pinned or hinge), and (3) semi-rigid.\n> Rigid joints are stiff connections.

We call these situations optimization problems. It is one of the elementary applications of differential calculus.\nIn dealing with these types of problems, we can summarize it in these steps:\n1.  Identify the Problem\n2.  Model Using a Function\n3.  Solve for Extrema\n4.  Evaluate Results\n## Example\nFor illustration purposes, we will answer a sample optimization problem: what is the largest open square box we can fold from a 700 sq. cm piece of paper?\nHow do we start or find a way to answer that mathematically?\n### Identify the Problem\n![Identifying what is given in an optimization problem](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35e7ec105ce4caba9c332_WTS-1-Mathematics_OptimizationProblems-1.png)\nThe first step is to identify what is required. In this problem, given a sheet of paper, we need to find the giant open box we can make with it. We can translate that problem as finding the maximum volume of a box given a paper of fixed area.\nLet's draw the open box and define some variables: \n-   \\\\(x\\\\) as the length of the square base \n-   \\\\(y\\\\) as the height of the box.\nNow, let's fold the paper to its shape. Since we have a paper of 700 sq. cm, the total surface area of the open box, when folded, must also be 700 sq. cm.\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Model Using a Function\nAfter identifying what is required, we create a model for it. We need to relate the volume of the open box with one of the dimensions of it. We start with identifying the primary expression for finding volumes of boxes. According to Cavalieri's theorem: \\\\(V=Ah\\\\).\n-   \\\\(V\\\\) is the volume of the open box\n-   \\\\(A\\\\) is the cross-sectional area of the object\n-   \\\\(h\\\\) is the height of the object\nWe can develop this equation using our predefined variables \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Expressing it in terms of these, we have \\\\(V=x^2y\\\\).\nThere are two variables, \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Although we can use this expression, we must find a way to express the primary function in terms of a single variable only (either \\\\(x\\\\) or \\\\(y\\\\)).\nTo do this, we make a secondary expression which we can get from its surface area, \\\\(s\\\\). For an open box, the variable \\\\(s\\\\) is the sum of the base area and four sides: \\\\(s = x^2+4xy\\\\). From our problem, this must equal 700 sq. cm. \n-   \\\\(s = x^2+4xy\\\\)\n-   \\\\(700 = x^2+4xy\\\\)\nWe can express one of the variables with the other. In our case, we isolate variable y and insert it into the primary function.\n-   \\\\(700 = x^2+4xy\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{175}{x}-\\frac{x}{4}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(V=x^2\\left(\\frac{175}{x}-\\frac{x}{4}\\right)\\\\)\nThis resulting equal is what we call the main [function](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions). We will use this expression to find the answer to our problem.\n### Solve for Extrema\n‍\nNow that we have the function between the box's volume \\\\(V\\\\) and the length of the square base \\\\(x\\\\), we can solve the problem. To start, let's plot this primary function.\nFrom the graph, there corresponds a \\\\(x\\\\) value where \\\\(V\\\\) is at its highest - or the maxima of the function. Our task is to find this coordinate.\nLet's recall that an extrema has a slope of zero.

To answer that question, let's turn our heads to Mechanics, the study of forces and energy among objects. _An object is said to be in a state of Equilibrium if and only if all forces and moments acting on it must balance each other._\nTo illustrate, try balancing a pencil on the tip of your finger. Usually, it would be best to find its center of gravity first, then place your finger on that point. Your finger will act as support on said point, and the pencil stays in position; that's Equilibrium in action.\nThe pencil's weight and your finger's supporting force balance each other. Because of this, the pencil remains stationary and in a state of rest. If you let it go from your hand, it will fall due to its weight; When that happens, there is no force balancing the pencil's weight, and the object will NOT be in a state of Equilibrium. Eventually, when it hits the ground, it will support the pencil and be in Equilibrium again.\nEquilibrium, in [structural analysis](/tree-posts/structural-analysis), is a crucial concept if we want to analyze our structures accurately.\n### Types\n![Difference between static and dynamic equilibrium](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea2d1261f58e01ab5407a_WTS-Structure_17.1-2.png)\nThere are two types of Equilibrium:\n-   **Static Equilibrium** deals with the Equilibrium of an object that is **at rest**. Meaning it doesn't move relative to another thing.\n-   **Dynamic Equilibrium** deals with the Equilibrium of an object that is **moving**. In this situation, the object moves at a constant velocity (zero acceleration).\nGenerally, we idealize structures as objects that must be at rest most of the time; hence, most analysis deals with static Equilibrium; however, there are instances when we have to consider earthquakes for buildings or wind forces for tall structures. In these situations, the frame may move considerably, and we may extend the analysis to dynamic Equilibrium.\n## What is Balance?\nWe say that an object is in balance if it satisfies the _two conditions of Equilibrium regardless of whether it is static or dynamic:_\n-   The summation of forces acting on the body must be zero: \\\\({\\sum}F=0\\\\)\n-   The summation of moments acting on the body must be zero: \\\\({\\sum}M=0\\\\)\nThe external forces and moments acting on any structure must balance out with the supports. In addition, when we isolate parts of the structure, the internal forces should balance with the applied external forces.\nFrom these two conditions, we can expound it to its components depending if the structure is 2D or 3D.\n### Plane Equilibrium\n![Example of plane equilibrium](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea2e8b7b67995fba8a120_WTS-Structure_17.1-3.png)\nConsider a standard 2D-Cartesian coordinate plane.

For a structure to be in Equilibrium:\n-   The summation of forces along the x, y, and z-directions is zero,\n-   The summation of moments about the x, y, and z-axes is zero;\nFrom this, there are **six** equations of Equilibrium.\n1.  \\\\({\\sum}F\\_x=0\\\\)\n2.  \\\\({\\sum}F\\_y=0\\\\)\n3.  \\\\({\\sum}F\\_z=0\\\\)\n4.  \\\\({\\sum}M\\_x=0\\\\)\n5.  \\\\({\\sum}M\\_y=0\\\\)\n6.  \\\\({\\sum}M\\_z=0\\\\)\n## Summary\n> Equilibrium describes the object's _state_ and deals with _balance_.\n> There are two types of Equilibrium: static and dynamic.

      "Free Content": "Let's continue with our [previous discussion](/tree-posts/what-is-external-and-internal-force). We learned that internal forces are something inherent in an object or system due to external forces.\nNow, we'll discuss it more - specifically, the types of internal forces. To illustrate, say we have a french fry in your hand - don't eat it! Let's apply some external forces to it and investigate what happens to it.\n## Axial Forces\n![Axial forces](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6575b6205b5fa099c450ae3c_WTS-1-Physics_TypesOfInternalForces-1.png)\nSay we apply a pulling force at the ends of the French Fry, like stretching it out. Observe that it will elongate along its length. Apply too much force, and it will eventually break at some point! We just applied a pulling external force that caused internal **tension forces**.\nInstead of pulling it, try to push its ends toward each other. We say that the French fry is now shorter or being compressed. Apply too much force, and the object tends to lump at some point. When we applied such pushing force, we made the French fry experience internal **compression force**.\nBoth of these forces, tension, and compression, are subtypes of what we call axial forces (or normal forces). These are internal forces in which the force is **perpendicular** to the surface. In our example, that surface would be the cross-section of the French Fry.\n## Shear Forces\n![Shear forces](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6575b62659dce2c486c04d9c_WTS-1-Physics_TypesOfInternalForces-2.png)\nNow, say we have a piece of scissors and cut the food slowly. As we apply such external force, we're creating a tear in the French Fry in the same cutting plane of our scissors. Entirely cut the food, and you would have two pieces of French Fry (yay!). The other piece slides _away_ from the original piece.\nWhen we cut the French Fry, some resisting internal force prevents it from tearing, which we call the **shear force**.\nIf axial forces are perpendicular to the surface, shear forces are **parallel**. In our example, our surface was the plane where we cut it - the cutting plane of the scissors. The external force from the scissors' blades lies in the plane parallel to it.\n## Bending\n![Bending moment](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6575b62c575238df86325779_WTS-1-Physics_TypesOfInternalForces-3.png)\nGet another piece of French Fry, and try to bend it this time. One can do that by holding the food's ends and rotating one's wrists to bend it. This action that enables an object to rotate about a fixed point or axis is what we call a **moment**. In our example, the fixed points are the ends of the French Fry.\nOne can bend French Fries to make its shape concave, convex, or simultaneously along specific points. Apply too much moment, and it will eventually break at some point. The French Fry offers an internal force that counteracts this external action and is the **bending moment**.\nA critical aspect of the bending moment is the reference. When we bend the French Fry, the axis of rotation of your wrists is NOT along the length of the French Fry but perpendicular to it.\n## Torsion\n![Torsion](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6575b633ae4a910bcf6e618e_WTS-1-Physics_TypesOfInternalForces-4.png)\nTake another piece of French fry and try to twist it at its ends as if you're wringing a towel. You're applying a rotational action called torque that causes it to twist along its length. The French Fry offers resistance to this action and is called **torsion**.\nIf the axis of rotation of bending moments is perpendicular to the plane of bending, the reference for torque is along the length of the French Fry. This reference makes it different from bending moments. These two are similar since they require a rotating moment or torque action.\n## Summary\n> There are four types of internal stresses: (1) axial, (2) shear, (3) bending moment, and (4) torsion.\n> Axial forces provide resistance for objects to elongate or shorten. These forces are perpendicular to the surface being investigated and can be tension (pulling force) or compression (pushing force).\n> Shearing forces provide resistance for objects to tear or slide at specific points. These forces are parallel to the surface.\n> Bending moments provide resistance for objects to bend about axes perpendicular to the plane where bending occurs.\n> Torsion provides resistance for objects to twist about their length.\n",

At its essence, it is a triangle with a 90-degree angle (right angle)—a simple definition but has countless applications across many disciplines.\n## Geometry\n![The right triangle](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35f235fd4aad2fbd73056_WTS-1-Mathematics_RightTriangle-1.png)\nThe right triangle consists of three sides \\\\(a\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(c\\\\).

We'll have two parts: a left and a right section.\nNaturally, this structure must be in a state of [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium). That includes when we cut it into two parts. \nLet's consider the left section. The external loads acting on it are the reaction and the load. For this part to be in equilibrium, the beam's fibers must provide a resisting force and moment to counteract these external forces.\nThe force resistance of the beam is what we call shear \\\\(V\\\\), while the moment resistance is its bending moment \\\\(M\\\\). \nThese two quantities will vary throughout their length. For example, the shear and moment at one end of the beam are different than at the midpoint. These quantities will depend on what point along the structure we wish to investigate.\n## Shear and Moment Conventions\nWhen we compute for shear and moment using equilibrium, these two quantities may be positive or negative. So, what does positive or negative shear or moment mean?\nThe sign will refer to the way the beam will bend. There are two conventions: (1) concaved upward convention and (2) concaved downward convention.\n### Concaved Upward Convention\n![Concaved upward convention](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455112738b941223da88e85_WTS-Structure_23.003-2.png)\nMost classical approach references will use this convention:\n-   A positive shear or moment means the member concaved upward.\n-   A negative shear or moment means the member concaved downward.\nIf we investigate the left section, the exposed shear acts downward (causes plane fibers of the beam to slide downward), and the moment is counterclockwise. These directions would concave the left part upward.\n### Concaved Downward Convention\n![Concaved downward convention](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/657478fc0000e7315a14d68e_WTS-6-Determinate Beam_ModelingShearAndMoment-001.png)\nThe concaved downward convention is the opposite of the previous convention:\n-   A positive shear or moment means the member concaved downward.\n-   A negative shear or moment means the member concaved upward.\nIf we investigate the left section, the exposed shear acts upward (causes plane fibers of the beam to slide\nupward), and the moment is clockwise. These directions would concave the left part downward.\n## Modelling Shear and Moment\nIn this section, we shall explore how to model shear and moment. We will use the concaved upward convention for the rest of this reference.\n### Analytical: Shear and Moment Equations\n![Default shear and moment equations for concaved upward convention](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6455113b3d3dd88cdd8fd7cd_WTS-Structure_23.003-3.png)\nWe can model shear and moment from an analytical perspective. The standard way to describe it is to express \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) as a [function](/tree/what-are-mathematical-functions) of \\\\(x\\\\). The variable \\\\(x\\\\) stands for the position of the cutting plane from a reference. \nTo create these functions, we use the [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations. Starting with the left section:\n-   \\\\(V=(\\sum{F\\_v})\\_L]\\uparrow\\_+\\\\). All external forces acting upward are positive, while downward are negative.\n-   \\\\(M=(\\sum{M})\\_L]\\circlearrowright\\_+\\\\). All external moments acting clockwise are positive, while counterclockwise are negative.\nOn the other hand, if we investigate the right section, the exposed shear acts upward, and the moment is clockwise. Likewise, these directions would concave the right part upward. As a result, the equations become:\n-   \\\\(V=(\\sum{F\\_v})\\_R]\\downarrow\\_+\\\\). All external forces acting downward are positive, while upward are negative.\n-   \\\\(M=(\\sum{M})\\_R]\\circlearrowleft\\_+\\\\). All external moments acting counterclockwise are positive, while clockwise are negative.\nAfter applying equilibrium, we get the shear and moment equations. Using these expressions, we can compute the \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) at any position \\\\(x\\\\) we want to investigate.\nIt is important to note that structures may change in loading condition or cross-sectional properties along their length; hence, we must [explicitly define](/tree-posts/what-are-explicit-and-implicit-domains) the domain of shear and moment functions. These equations apply only to a specific range of \\\\(x\\\\). We can discover more of this using an [illustrative problem](/tree-posts/how-to-form-shear-and-moment-equations) later on.\n### Graphical: Shear and Moment Diagrams\n![Shear and moment diagrams](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/657479103d2e56f361f46d3b_WTS-6-Determinate Beam_ModelingShearAndMoment-002.png)\nSince shear and moment equations are mathematical functions, we can plot these into a graph and visualize these equations. These graphs \\\\(V-x\\\\) or \\\\(M-x\\\\) are the shear and moment diagrams.\nThese graphs are standard tools to visualize how shear and moment act along the structure under the effect of external loads.\nA fascinating relationship exists between a structure's external load, shear, and moment. We can discover more about it in this [link](/tree-posts/what-are-load-shear-and-moment-relationships).\n## Applications\nBelow are examples that demonstrate how to model shear and moment as well as evaluate it:\n-   [Example](/tree-posts/how-to-form-shear-and-moment-equations) of constructing shear and moment equations and diagrams\n-   How to [assess shear and moment](/tree-posts/how-to-evaluate-shear-and-moment) at a point\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> When a structure experiences flexural loads, it will experience shear \\\\(V\\\\) and moment \\\\(M\\\\).\n> When we cut a flexural member at a point, we divide it into two parts.

      "Free Content": "The function's first derivative tells us many things about the [math function](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) itself. In this post, we'll explore its most essential meaning.\n## The First Derivative is the Slope\nLet's start by defining what the first derivative is. At its basic, it tells us the steepness of the function \\\\(f\\\\). In other words, it is the slope \\\\(m\\\\) of the \\\\(f\\\\).\n\\\\(y'=\\frac{dy}{dx}=f^{\\prime}(x)=m\\\\)\nTo illustrate, consider the [quadratic function](/tree-posts/what-are-polynomial-functions) \\\\(f(x)=y=5x^2+3\\\\). The first derivative is equal to \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=10x\\\\). It means that the function's slope is equal to \\\\(10x\\\\). With this expression, we can determine the slope of the tangent line at any point along the curve. Say we want to find the slope at \\\\(x=1\\\\), we substitute it to \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=10x\\\\) \n-   \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=10x\\\\) \n-   \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}=10(1)=10\\\\)\nAt \\\\(x=1\\\\), the slope of the [parabola](/tree-posts/parabola) at that point is equal to 10. We can further verify this by drawing a tangent line at that point and solving for the tangent line's slope using a graphing utility.\n‍\n## Interpreting First Derivative\nAside from telling us the slope, we can interpret if the given function increases, decreases, or remains the same with the first derivative.\nTo illustrate these three conditions, consider a math function \\\\(f\\\\) and two values \\\\(x\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(x\\_2\\\\) so that \\\\(x\\_2 \\gt x\\_1\\\\). We'll also explore the slopes of the function along these points. We can summarize increasing, decreasing, and constant functions using the table below:\n‍\n-   If \\\\(f(x\\_1) \\gt f(x\\_2)\\\\), then the graph is moving downward or decreasing. The slope of the tangent lines for decreasing functions is negative.\n-   If \\\\(f(x\\_1) \\lt f(x\\_2)\\\\), then it is moving upward or increasing. The slope of the tangent lines for increasing functions is positive.\n-   If \\\\(f(x\\_1) = f(x\\_2)\\\\), then the graph is constant. The slope is zero for constant functions.\nWith this table, we can relate increasing, decreasing, and constant functions using the sign convention of \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\):\n-   If \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\) is negative on a certain interval, then the function is decreasing.\n-   If \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\) is positive on a certain interval, then it is increasing.\n-   If \\\\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\) equals zero on a certain interval, then it is zero.\n## Summary\n> The first derivative tells us the steepness of the function \\\\(f\\\\).

Let's start by discussing what a monomial is:\n## Monomial\nA monomial is a mathematical expression that consists of two things:\n-   A constant coefficient \\\\(a\\\\) and\n-   A variable \\\\(x\\\\)\nIf we have an expression like \\\\(5x\\\\), the coefficient is five, and the variable is \\\\(x\\\\). It's straightforward as that.\nA monomial would have at least a degree – the sum of the exponents of the variables. In the expression \\\\(5x\\\\), the degree is equal to one (since the variable's exponent is one). If we have something like \\\\(2x^2y\\\\), the degree is three (2+1=3).\n## Polynomial\nWhen we perform a series of math operations among monomials, we have a polynomial.\nThe expression \\\\(5x^4+2x^2y\\\\) is a polynomial. From this example, we can observe the following:\n-   The expression consists of two monomials: \\\\(5x^4\\\\) and \\\\(2x^2y\\\\)\n-   The first one, \\\\(5x^4\\\\), has a coefficient of 5 and a degree of four, while the second one, \\\\(2x^2y\\\\), has a coefficient of 2 and a degree of three.\nMost references call the monomials in polynomials \"terms.\" From this point forward, we will refer to these as such.\nAll polynomial expressions would have the degree of the polynomial \\\\(n\\\\). It is equal to the term with the highest degree. In the expression: \\\\(5x^4+2x^2y\\\\)\n-   The degree of the polynomial \\\\(n\\\\) is four since the term with the highest degree equals it.\n### General Form\nFrom these illustrations, we can express every polynomial in a general form:\n\\\\(a\\_n x^n+a\\_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a\\_2 x^2+a\\_1 x+a\\_0\\\\)\n-   \\\\(a\\_n\\\\), \\\\(a\\_{n-1}\\\\), and so forth are the coefficients of the polynomial\n-   \\\\(n\\\\) is the degree of the polynomial\n-   \\\\(a\\_n\\\\) is the leading coefficient of the polynomial - the constant of the highest degree term\n-   \\\\(a\\_0\\\\) is the constant coefficient of the polynomial - the constant of the term without a variable\n## Summary\n> A monomial is a mathematical expression that consists of two things: a constant coefficient \\\\(a\\\\) and variable \\\\(x\\\\)\n> A monomial would have at least a degree – the sum of the exponents of the variables.\n> When we perform a series of math operations among monomials, we have a polynomial.\n> Most references call the monomials in polynomials \"terms.\"\n> All polynomial expressions would have the degree of the polynomial \\\\(n\\\\). \n> We can express every polynomial in a general form: \\\\(a\\_n x^n+a\\_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a\\_2 x^2+a\\_1 x+a\\_0\\\\)\n",

Both fields deal with the study of forces. The former deals with objects at rest, while the latter deals with moving objects. When we refer to structural analysis, we have the same concept, but this usually refers to the type of load the structure may experience, which can be either static or dynamic.\n## Structural Statics\n[Static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads) refer to loads that don't generate acceleration effects on the structure, such as dead loads and live loads. \nSome loads cause these effects, such as the impact loading of vehicles and locomotives. For example, you might feel the bridge shake when a car crosses it. That is an example of an acceleration effect; however, in some cases, most express it only as a percentage to simplify the load analysis. In that way, those impact loads become static loads.\n## Structural Dynamics\nWhen loads cause acceleration effects on the structure, these are [dynamic loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads). Wind gusts, earthquake loads, and blasts from weapons are all examples of such loads. When our analysis deals with these loadings, it is dynamic. This type has many forms, such as time history and response spectrum analysis.\n## Summary\n> Loads can either be static or dynamic.\n> Static loads do not generate acceleration effects on the structure (structural statics).\n> Dynamic loads cause acceleration effects on the building (structural dynamics).\n",

The object consists of a uniform cross-section throughout its whole length. We generated the solid by revolving the area along its axis of rotation, which doesn't lie along the area boundary. \nWe must divide the solid into multiple parts to estimate the total volume. We can imagine these parts as a series of similar plane sections stacked on each other to make up the 3D object.\nFor a solid of revolution, we can divide it into either discs or shells. For this post, we will use discs.\nThere is a problem when we use discs in this example - we have an open portion in the middle. Rather than using a solid disc, we use a hollow version of it which we call washers.\nFrom this, we begin the process of approximating:\n1.  First, divide the 3D object into multiple regular washers.\n2.  Then, we solve the volume \\\\(V\\\\) of each divided washer. From Cavalieri's theorem, \\\\(V=Ah\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is the uniform cross-sectional area and \\\\(h\\\\) is the length of the solid. Since it is a circular washer, \\\\(A\\\\) is equal to \\\\(\\pi (R^2-r^2)\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is the outer radius and \\\\(r\\\\) is the inner radius.\n3.  Finally, we add all individual \\\\(V\\\\) to get the total approximate volume.\nSince this is an approximation, how can we have a more accurate answer? We increase the number of washers \\\\(n\\\\). \n-   When we increase the number of washers, it will be closer to the actual value. \n-   As the number of washers increases, the smaller its volume \\\\(dV\\\\) and thickness \\\\(h\\\\) become.\n",

Building from this, we can solve the precise volume. We will only need to modify two things in the approximate solution: \n-   We need to set up a solid washer that is so small we can express its volume as the differential \\\\(dV\\\\)\n-   We need an operation that will sum up all of these tiny divisions\nWe can combine all \\\\(dV\\\\) through integration; hence, the general equation to solve for the volume \\\\(V\\_T\\\\) is:\n\\\\(V\\_T=\\int\\_{a}^{b}{dV}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(V\\_T\\\\) is the total volume\n-   \\\\(dV\\\\) is the differential volume of the division.\n-   \\\\(a\\\\) is the lower limit position (endpoint with the lowest value)\n-   \\\\(b\\\\) is the upper limit position (endpoint with the highest value)\nThis equation is similar to solving the volume of solids using integration with uniform cross-sections.

The truss may deform too much or even collapse instantly. This event happens because no diagonal in panel \\\\(BDEC\\\\) would retain its general shape. From this example, you can see that the truss is unstable - a case of instability!\nTo avoid this, the arrangement of members must make the whole truss rigid.

We put any number \\\\(r\\\\) in the expression to get the corresponding \\\\(A\\\\) value. The radius \\\\(r\\\\) is the domain of the function, while the area \\\\(A\\\\) is the range because it depends on radius \\\\(r\\\\).\n## Functions are Input-Output Expressions\n![Functions are input-output expressions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e341d03271e9048e4c7576_WTS-1-Mathematics_MathematicalFunctions-2.png)\nUsually, we think of functions as: _\"input-output expressions.\"_ It's as if it is a vending machine. We put our money and order into it; then, the device processes it. Finally, the vending machine will give out something in return.\nLet's illustrate this analogy using the area-radius example. Say that we're interested in finding the area of a circle \\\\(A\\\\) given a radius \\\\(r\\\\) of one:\n-   Let the mathematical function between the area \\\\(A\\\\) and radius \\\\(r\\\\) be \\\\(\\pi{r^2}\\\\)\n-   We input radius one into the function: \\\\(\\pi\\times{1^2}\\\\)\n-   The function solves it using mathematical operations.\n-   The function gives us \\\\(\\pi\\\\) square units as our output.\n## Function Leads Only To One Result\nOne characteristic of functions is that these must only give one result! \nLet's consider the area-radius expression again. If we were given an \\\\(r\\\\) of one into the function, it must only provide one answer: \\\\(\\pi\\\\) square units. We don't expect two answers for area \\\\(A\\\\) if we enter a single radius \\\\(r\\\\).

An example of that is the expression for square numbers: \\\\(y=x^2\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) is any real number, and \\\\(y\\\\) is the square of said number. To illustrate this, let's take the square of +2, which is +4. In addition, the square of -2 is also +4. In this example:\n-   The inputs are -2 and +2, \\\\(x\\\\)\n-   The function is \\\\(x^2\\\\) \n-   The output is +4, \\\\(y\\\\)\nWe can have many inputs in a function.

      "Paid Content": "There are two ways to solve this problem using the double integration method: segment analysis and [general equation analysis](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-double-integration-method-using-a-general-equation). This post explains the former.\n### Set Up Equations\nThe first step in this method is to formulate the [moment equations](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment) per segment which we can see here.\nEquation 1-1: \\\\(M\\_{AB}=27,\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\lt {2}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 1-2: \\\\(M\\_{BC}=-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3},\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\lt {6.5}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 1-3: \\\\(M\\_{CD}=-18 x^2+\\frac{891}{4} x-\\frac{1629}{4},\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\lt {11}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 1-4: \\\\(M\\_{DE}=90x-1125,\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\lt {12.5}\\\\}\\\\)\nAlso, if there are any variations in \\\\(E\\\\) and \\\\(I\\\\), we have to [express it in terms of \\\\(x\\\\)](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions); however, since the [flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) is constant for this example, we disregard this effect.\n### Apply Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation\nNext, we apply the [Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation](/tree-posts/what-is-the-bernoulli-euler-beam-theory) to each moment equation (as well as the functions of \\\\(E\\\\) and \\\\(I\\\\), if any):\nEquation 2-1: \\\\(\\frac{d^2 \\Delta}{d x^2}=\\frac{1}{E I}(27),\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\lt {2}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 2-2: \\\\(\\frac{d^2 \\Delta}{d x^2}=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} x^3+10 x^2+70 x-\\frac{419}{3}\\right),\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\lt {6.5}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 2-3: \\\\(\\frac{d^2 \\Delta}{d x^2}=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-18 x^2+\\frac{891}{4} x-\\frac{1629}{4}\\right),\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\lt {11}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 2-4: \\\\(\\frac{d^2 \\Delta}{d x^2}=\\frac{1}{E I}(90 x-1125),\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\lt {12.5}\\\\}\\\\)\n### Find General Solution\nAfterward, we are ready to find the slope and deflection equations per segment.\n#### General Slope Equations\nLet's start by finding the [general](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation-solution) slope equation. We integrate each Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation once to get such equations:\nEquation 3-1: \\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(27 x+C\\_1\\right),\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\lt {2}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 3-2: \\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{12} x^4+\\frac{10}{3} x^3+35 x^2-\\frac{419}{3} x+C\\_2\\right),\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\lt {6.5}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 3-3: \\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-6 x^3+\\frac{891}{8} x^2-\\frac{1629}{4} x+C\\_3\\right),\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\lt {11}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 3-4: \\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(45 x^2-1125 x+C\\_4\\right),\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\lt {12.5}\\\\}\\\\)\n#### General Deflection Equations\nAfter getting the general slope equations, we integrate these again to get the deflection equations per segment:\nEquation 4-1: \\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(\\frac{27}{2} x^2+C\\_1 x+C\\_5\\right),\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\lt {2}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 4-2: \\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{1}{12} x^5+\\frac{5}{6} x^4+\\frac{35}{3} x^3-\\frac{419}{6} x^2+C\\_2 x+C\\_6\\right),\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\lt {6.5}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 4-3: \\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{3}{2} x^4+\\frac{891}{24} x^3-\\frac{1629}{8} x^2+C\\_3 x+C\\_7\\right),\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\lt {11}\\\\}\\\\)\nEquation 4-4: \\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(15 x^3-\\frac{1125}{2} x^2+C\\_4 x+C\\_8\\right),\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\lt {12.5}\\\\}\\\\)\n### Find Particular Solution\nAfter finding the general slope and deflection solutions, we must find the [particular](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation-solution) solution to our example. \nThere are eight general expressions - one for rotation and one for translation for \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), and \\\\(DE\\\\). In each of these, there are at most two constants of integration per segment - totaling eight constants (\\\\(C\\_1\\\\), \\\\(C\\_2\\\\), \\\\(C\\_3\\\\), \\\\(C\\_4\\\\), \\\\(C\\_5\\\\), \\\\(C\\_6\\\\), \\\\(C\\_7\\\\), and \\\\(C\\_8\\\\)) To find a particular solution, we need to solve for these eight constants. We can do this by establishing several conditions first.\n#### Conditions\nConditions are constraints or facts that we know about the structure. In this example, we're asking ourselves: what do we know about the deflected shape of the beam?\nThe number of conditions required is equal to the number of constants of integration. So, if we have eight constants, we need at least eight conditions.\nWe'll discuss two types of conditions: continuity and boundary.\n##### Continuity Conditions\nLet's draw an approximate deflected shape of our beam. Consider two adjacent segments, such as \\\\(AB\\\\) and \\\\(BC\\\\), and their common point \\\\(B(2,0)\\\\). At this point, the rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\) of \\\\(AB\\\\) and \\\\(BC\\\\) must be the same; so, at \\\\((2, 0)\\\\), Equations 3-1 and 3-2 must be equal:\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{A B}=\\theta\\_{B C}, x=2\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[27(2)+C\\_1\\right]=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[-\\frac{5}{12}(2)^4+\\frac{10}{3}(2)^3+35(2)^2-\\frac{419}{3}(2)+C\\_2\\right]\\\\)\nContinuity Condition 1: \\\\(C\\_1-C\\_2=-\\frac{520}{3}\\\\)\nSimilarly, the translation \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) of \\\\(AB\\\\) and \\\\(BC\\\\) is also the same at point \\\\(B\\\\); Or, Equations 4-1 and 4-2 must be alike.\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{A B}=\\Delta\\_{B C}, x=2\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[\\frac{27}{2}(2)^2+C\\_1(2)+C\\_5\\right]=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[-\\frac{1}{12}(2)^5+\\frac{5}{6}(2)^4+\\frac{35}{3}(2)^3-\\frac{419}{6}(2)^2+C\\_2(2)+C\\_6\\right]\\\\)\nContinuity Condition 2: \\\\(2 C\\_1-2 C\\_2+C\\_5-C\\_6=-\\frac{688}{3}\\\\)\nThe deflection components at the meeting point must be the same to ensure a continuous deflected shape. There should be no abrupt deflection changes at intersection points between segments (except for special instances).\nWith this in mind, let's continue establishing conditions. At \\\\(C (6.5, 0)\\\\), the rotation for \\\\(BC\\\\) and \\\\(CD\\\\) are equal (3-2 = 3-3):\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{B C}=\\theta\\_{C D}, x=6.5\\\\)\nContinuity Condition 3: \\\\(C\\_2-C\\_3=-331.84\\\\)\nLikewise, the translation at \\\\(C\\\\) for both \\\\(BC\\\\) and \\\\(CD\\\\) is also equal (4-2 = 4-3):\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{B C}=\\Delta\\_{C D}, x=6.5\\\\)\nContinuity Condition 4: \\\\(6.5 C\\_2-6.5 C\\_3+C\\_6-C\\_7=-1859.44\\\\)\nThe only remaining possible condition is the shared joint between segments \\\\(CD\\\\) and \\\\(DE\\\\). Similarly, the rotation and translation of said segments are equal at \\\\((11, 0)\\\\): (3-3 = 3-4, 4-3 = 4-4)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{C D}=\\theta\\_{D E}, x=11\\\\)\nContinuity Condition 5: \\\\(C\\_3-C\\_4=-\\frac{63525}{8}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{C D}=\\Delta\\_{D E}, x=11\\\\)\nContinuity Condition 6: \\\\(11 C\\_3-11 C\\_4+C\\_7-C\\_8=-\\frac{203643}{4}\\\\)\nWith all possible adjacent segments considered, we have created six conditions; however, we still need two conditions to complete the eight.\n##### Boundary Conditions\nThe [other condition](/tree-posts/what-are-boundary-conditions) we would need to set up deals with the restrictions of the deflected shape at the supports. For example, fixed supports in ideal cantilevers or restrained beams do not permit any form of deflection.\nLook at our roller support at point \\\\(B (2, 0)\\\\). One restriction is that there should be no vertical translation at said point. Using this fact, we can create another condition by using 4-2 to express the following:\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{B\\_v}=0, x=2\\\\)\n\\\\(0=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[\\frac{27}{2}(2)^2+C\\_1(2)+C\\_5\\right]\\\\)\nBoundary Condition 1: \\\\(2 C\\_1+C\\_5=-54\\\\)\nYou can also use 4-3 to express the roller condition since both segments \\\\(AB\\\\) and \\\\(BC\\\\) share the constraint simultaneously.\n\\\\(0=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{1}{12}(2)^5+\\frac{5}{6}(2)^4+\\frac{35}{5}(2)^3-\\frac{419}{6}(2)^2+C\\_2(2)+C\\_6\\right)\\\\)\nBoundary Condition 2: \\\\(2 C\\_2+C\\_6=\\frac{526}{3}\\\\)\nLet's move on to the hinge support at point \\\\(D (11, 0)\\\\). Likewise, there shouldn't be any translation in this position. We can use either segment \\\\(CD\\\\) or \\\\(DE\\\\) to express this constraint (4-3 or 4-4):\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{D\\_v}=0, x=11\\\\)\nBoundary Condition 3: \\\\(11 C\\_3+C\\_7=-\\frac{11253}{4}\\\\)\nBoundary Condition 4: \\\\(11 C\\_4+C\\_8=\\frac{96195}{2}\\\\)\nWe have made four conditions in terms of boundary constraints. Since we already have six conditions from continuity, we only need another two.\nWe get each per support; in this case, one for the roller at \\\\(B\\\\) and another for the hinge at \\\\(D\\\\).\nWe can use any of the combinations:\n-   Boundary Conditions 1 and 3\n-   Boundary Conditions 1 and 4\n-   Boundary Conditions 2 and 3\n-   Boundary Conditions 2 and 4\nIn our example, we will use Boundary Conditions 1 and 3. \n#### Solving the Constants of Integration\nWith eight conditions created, we are ready to solve for the constants simultaneously. \nWe can solve systems of linear equations algebraically, but for many unknowns, it is preferable to solve them using matrices. \n\\\\(\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\2 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\0 & 6.5 & -6.5 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\0 & 0 & 11 & -11 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\0 & 0 & 11 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}  \n\\begin{bmatrix}C\\_1 \\\\\\\\C\\_2 \\\\\\\\C\\_3 \\\\\\\\C\\_4 \\\\\\\\C\\_5 \\\\\\\\C\\_6 \\\\\\\\C\\_7 \\\\\\\\C\\_8\\end{bmatrix}  \n=\\begin{bmatrix}-\\frac{520}{3} \\\\\\\\\\-\\frac{688}{3} \\\\\\\\\\-331.84 \\\\\\\\\\-1859.44 \\\\\\\\\\-\\frac{63525}{8} \\\\\\\\\\-\\frac{203643}{4} \\\\\\\\\\-54 \\\\\\\\\\-\\frac{11253}{4}\\end{bmatrix}\\\\)\nIn the end, we'll have the following results:\n\\\\(\\begin{bmatrix}C\\_1 \\\\\\\\C\\_2 \\\\\\\\C\\_3 \\\\\\\\C\\_4 \\\\\\\\C\\_5 \\\\\\\\C\\_6 \\\\\\\\C\\_7 \\\\\\\\C\\_8\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}-877.92 \\\\\\\\\\-704.59 \\\\\\\\\\-372.75 \\\\\\\\7567.88 \\\\\\\\1701.84 \\\\\\\\1584.51 \\\\\\\\1287 \\\\\\\\\\-35149.13\\end{bmatrix}\\\\)\n### Summarize Equations\nWith constants of integration solved, the final step is to summarise the slope and deflection equations per segment by substituting constants of integration to the general slope and deflection equations:\n#### Slope Equations\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}(27 x-877.92),\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\lt {2}\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{5}{12} x^4+\\frac{10}{3} x^3+35 x^2-\\frac{419}{3} x-704.59\\right),\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\lt {6.5}\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-6 x^3+\\frac{891}{8} x^2-\\frac{1629}{4} x-372.75\\right),\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\lt {11}\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{d \\Delta}{d x}=\\theta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(45 x^2-1125 x+7567.88\\right),\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\lt {12.5}\\\\}\\\\)\n#### Deflection Equations\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(\\frac{27}{2} x^2-877.92 x+1701.84\\right),\\\\{0\\leq{x}\\lt {2}\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{1}{12} x^5+\\frac{5}{6} x^4+\\frac{35}{3} x^3-\\frac{419}{6} x^2-704.59 x+1584.51\\right),\\\\{2\\leq{x}\\lt {6.5}\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(-\\frac{3}{2} x^4+\\frac{891}{24} x^3-\\frac{1629}{8} x^2-372.75 x+1287\\right),\\\\{6.5\\leq{x}\\lt {11}\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left(15 x^3-\\frac{1125}{2} x^2+7567.88 x-35149.13\\right),\\\\{11\\leq{x}\\lt {12.5}\\\\}\\\\)\nThe equations above are the slope and deflection equations of the beam example per segment. With this, you can determine the rotation or translation at any beam point.\n## Slope and Deflection Diagrams\nWe can represent these equations using a graph. If we plot the slope \\\\(\\theta\\\\) against position \\\\(x\\\\) and deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) against \\\\(x\\\\), we get the slope and deflection diagrams of the structure.\n‍\nThese diagrams assume the beam example's [flexural rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) \\\\(EI\\\\) is constant.\n",

      "Free Content": "Let's recall that one of the [primary functions](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structure) of any structure is to resist any [load](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-loads) it may experience. Ideally, when that happens, we expect it to remain as is - same position and same shape; however, that is not the case.\nOne important thing to note about forces is that it reshapes and deflects objects from their original place. For example, when we sit on a bench, it may bend. Sometimes we may feel this depression when we sit down. When you walk along a concrete beam, it deflects but is imperceptible.\nThe object's actual shape after imposing loads on it is its deflected shape.\n## What is Compatibility?\n![Overview of deflection](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea3360c43434d21aa2ff6_WTS-Structure_17.2-1.png)\n_Compatibility refers to the balance between the structure's deflected shape and the structural loads imposed on it._ Usually, what we're analyzing here is the relationship between the applied loads and the deflected shape of the object - we're making sure these two connect well.\nLet's move to a structural example. If we impose a downward vertical force on a beam, we expect it to bend concavely. We don't expect its deflected shape to elongate or twist. The object's shape should change appropriately with the applied force.\n## Compatibility Conditions\n![Example of compatibility conditions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea34ed58cc790db28c6d5_WTS-Structure_17.2-2.png)\nWe use this concept to find the known movements for specific points of the structure. From there, we derive what we call _compatibility conditions_ which are [boundary conditions](/tree-posts/what-are-boundary-conditions).\nLet's illustrate this by investigating roller supports. Recall that these carry the structure's loads and tell us about movement restraints. A roller can move along the surface or rotate; however, it cannot move perpendicularly to the supporting plane. That restricted movement along the vertical is the condition we are interested in taking note of.\n### Where Do We Use Compatibility Conditions?\nWe'll explore using these conditions as we go along the course. As a taste, we create these conditions and use them in the solution of:\n-   **[Deflections](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection).** We use it as boundary conditions that help us know the movement of a structure at a specific point.\n-   **Statically Indeterminate Structures.** When dealing with these structures, these conditions are mandatory! They are the additional equations needed to solve the skeleton.\n## Summary\n> The deflected shape on the structure is the actual shape when it's imposed with loads.\n> Compatibility refers to the balance between the structure's deflected shape and the effect of structural loads imposed on it.\n> Compatibility conditions are equations that tell us general deflection conditions at specific points of the structure.\n",

This method aims to find an expression for the structure's deflected shape. From there, we can describe the deflection at every beam point. The question is: how do we exactly do that?\n## Key Idea: Integrate the Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation\nTo understand this method, one must understand the [Bernoulli-Euler Beam model and equation](/tree-posts/what-is-the-bernoulli-euler-beam-theory). We recommend reading it first if you're unfamiliar with it.\nIt is a beam theory that describes the beam's behavior under flexural loads.

Depending on the situation, we can have as many inputs as we can place. There are also other situations where we only limit the number of inputs.\n## Two Types of Domain\n![Implicit and explicit domains](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e3563453b7f6aca7da18ec_WTS-1-Mathematics_ExplicitAndImplicitDomains-1.png)\nWhen it comes to functions, it's essential to define the [domain](/tree-posts/what-are-relations), which can be (1) implicit or (2) explicit.\nMathematically, an implicit domain means the input is the set of all inputs, while an explicit means that it is limited based on some criteria.\nTo illustrate this, let's look at the radius r-area function: \\\\(A(r)=\\pi{r^2}\\\\). \n-   The domain is the set of all possible values for the radius. \n-   Radii can only be a positive number (not less than zero). It usually doesn't make sense if we have a negative radius.\n-   As a result, we can further expand the function as \\\\(A(r)=\\pi{r^2}\\\\), where \\\\(r\\geq0\\\\).\nIf a condition like \\\\(r\\geq0\\\\) exists, we have defined the domain, making it explicit.\nHowever, if there is no stated condition in the function, then it is implied that the domain can be any real mathematical number. As a result, the domain is implicit.\nWhen we have an explicitly-defined domain, the range will also limit itself. Returning to the radius-area example, we will only have positive areas as an output if we have only positive radii as inputs.\n## Summary\n> Domains can either be implicitly or explicitly defined.\n> An implicit domain means the input is the set of all inputs, while an explicit means that it is limited based on some criteria.\n",

      "Free Content": "In structural analysis, some methods will use work and energy concepts. This article is a refresher on those ideas.\n## What is Work?\n![Definition of work](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cb298e9cf57cd36d567d_WTS-Structure_19.4-1.png)\nAt its simplest, work \\\\(W\\\\) happens if a force or moment causes something to move. It is a scalar product of force \\\\(P\\\\) and displacement \\\\({\\Delta}\\\\) or moment \\\\(M\\\\) and rotation \\\\({\\theta}\\\\): \\\\(W=P{\\times}{\\Delta}\\\\) or \\\\(W=M{\\times}{\\theta}\\\\)\nThe basic unit of work is the Joule \\\\(J\\\\), equivalent to \\\\(1 N•m\\\\). Graphically speaking, work is the area under a \\\\(P-∆\\\\) or \\\\(M-θ\\\\) graph.\n### Must Be In Same Line of Action!\n![Work must be in the same line of action](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cb40443cd29db0a1af59_WTS-Structure_19.4-2.png)\nIn addition to our basic definitions, work only exists if \\\\(F\\\\) and \\\\(∆\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(θ\\\\) are acting in the same path.\nTo illustrate, consider an object, say a box. We apply a pushing force \\\\(P\\\\) on it.\n-   Force \\\\(P\\\\) can be broken down to its components along the \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\)-axes: \\\\(P\\_x\\\\) and \\\\(P\\_y\\\\) respectively.\n-   There is work done with \\\\(P\\_x\\\\) and \\\\({\\Delta}\\\\) because \\\\(P\\_x\\\\) and \\\\({\\Delta}\\\\) act in the same line which is the \\\\(+x\\\\)-axis (parallel to each other); however, \n-   there is no work done with \\\\(P\\_y\\\\) and \\\\({\\Delta}\\\\) because the paths are perpendicular to each other.\nThe same is valid with rotation, \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\({\\theta}\\\\) must be acting on the same line of action to have work.\n### Positive and Negative Work\n![Difference between positive and negative work](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea6026d7e2c0871751533_WTS-Structure_19.4-3.png)\nIn addition, work can either be positive or negative:\n-   Work is positive if the net force (or net moment) has the same direction as the displacement (or rotation).\n-   It is negative if the net force (or net moment) and displacement (or rotation) are opposite.\n### Total Work or Net Work\nGiven a body, many forces may act on it. As such, these forces may perform multiple work on it (either positive or negative). The algebraic sum of all these work on the body is what we call [total work](/tree-posts/net-work) \\\\(W\\_{tot}\\\\).\n\\\\(W\\_{tot}={\\sum}W\\\\)\n### Virtual Work\n![Difference between real and virtual work](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645a5136b8d2913ff29f00ef_WTS-Structure_Energy_001.png)\nWe said that work is \\\\(W=P{\\times}{\\Delta}\\\\) or \\\\(W=M{\\times}{\\theta}\\\\). If both of these quantities are actual, we call this real work.\nHowever, if either is an imaginary quantity, we call it virtual work. As such, there are two possible instances in which there is virtual work:\n-   **Real** force \\\\(P\\\\) times **fictional** displacement \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), or **real** moment \\\\(M\\\\) times **imaginary** rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n-   **Imaginary** force \\\\(P\\\\) times **actual** displacement \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), or **fictional** moment \\\\(M\\\\) times **actual** rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\).\n## What is Energy?\n![Definition of energy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645a51452abc013bab2c68ed_WTS-Structure_Energy_002.png)\nLet's now move on to a related term, energy, which is the ability to do work.\nWork and energy are related and sometimes interchangeable concepts. These scalar quantities have the same SI unit (Joule, \\\\(J\\\\)). \nThe difference is that work happens if some external force causes movement, while energy is inherent in an object or system. For example, we say a battery has \"chemical energy \"instead of \"chemical work\" because it is natural for such a thing to have.\n### Potential and Kinetic Energy\n![Difference between potential and kinetic energy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645a515aa7ab2a22fb2f6d04_WTS-Structure_Energy_004.png)\nThere are two general categories of energy: potential \\\\(U\\\\) and kinetic energy \\\\(K\\\\); The former deals with \"energy at rest,\" or due to its position, while the latter is \"energy in motion.\"\nPotential energy has many forms. Example include gravitational \\\\(U\\_g\\\\), elastic \\\\(U\\_e\\\\), and chemical \\\\(U\\_c\\\\). Each of these types deserves a separate discussion.\nKinetic energy is the amount of work needed to bring an object of mass \\\\(m\\\\) from rest to a speed of \\\\(V\\\\). Equation-wise, \\\\(K\\\\) is:\n\\\\(K=\\frac{1}{2}mV^2\\\\)\n### Energy Forms\n![Different energy forms](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645a51559a9bab75bf8bc009_WTS-Structure_Energy_003.png)\nWe can also express energy in different forms depending on the source and nature of things. As a taste, here are some examples:\n-   Mechanical Energy is the sum of potential and kinetic energy on a visible scale.\n-   Strain Energy is potential energy due to the deformation of an object.\n-   Thermal Energy is kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of particles.\n## Work-Energy Theorem\nThe total work \\\\(W\\_{tot}\\\\) on a body is related to two things: (1) the displacement and (2) the speed of the body. We can see these relationships in the work-energy theorem.\nGiven the kinetic energy of a body before and after its movement as \\\\(K\\_1\\\\) and \\\\(K\\_2\\\\) and the total work done \\\\(W\\_{tot}\\\\), the work-energy states that:\n\\\\(W\\_{tot}=\\Delta{K}=K\\_2-K\\_1\\\\)\nThe change in kinetic energy equals the total work done on the body.\n## Law of Conservation of Energy\n![Example of Conservation of Energy](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645a517a1c9d8cb155be6c86_WTS-Structure_Energy_005.png)\nAny Physics class will discuss the Law of Conservation of Energy which tells us that energy can never be created nor destroyed. In some references, this law is called the Law of Conservation of Work and Energy.\nIt implies the following:\n-   It transfers from one object to another. \n-   It converts from one form to another.\nTo illustrate, when we exercise, the energy we create from moving turns into heat. We didn't lose said work; it just converted into another form.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Work \\\\(W\\\\) happens if a force or moment causes something to move: \\\\(W=P{\\times}{\\Delta}\\\\) or \\\\(W=M{\\times}{\\theta}\\\\). It is a scalar quantity with SI Unit Joule \\\\(J\\\\)\n> Work only exists if \\\\(F\\\\) and \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) are acting in the same path.\n> Work is positive if the net force (or net moment) has the same direction as the displacement (or rotation), while it is negative if the net force (or net moment) and displacement (or rotation) are opposite to each other.\n> Total work or \"net\" work is the algebraic sum of all individual work acting on a body.\n> Virtual work happens when one of these variables, \\\\(F\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\\\), is an imaginary quantity.\n> Energy is the ability to do work. It has the SI Unit Joule \\\\(J\\\\)\n> Energy has two general categories: potential and kinetic energy; The former deals with \"energy at rest,\" while the latter is \"energy in motion.\"\n> Energy can be expressed in different forms: mechanical energy, electrical energy, and many more.\n> The Work-Energy Theorem states that the change in kinetic energy equals the total work done on the body.\n> The Law of Conservation of Energy is an important concept. Energy can never be created nor destroyed.\n",

It only applies to definite values, not equations._\n_We will update this post to reflect solutions in the English system soon._\n## Structural Model\nLet's consider a [compound beam](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-beams) example. In this instance, we have two beams connected by an [internal hinge](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports). It is assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material).\n![Compound beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645520d73a388cb0ff55ec01_WTS-Structure_23.06-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe beam has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A varying linear load from \\\\(60kN/m (4.11kip/ft)\\\\) to \\\\(0\\\\) **↓**.\n-   A varying linear load from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(30kN/m (2.06kip/ft)\\\\) **↓**.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Beam, Determinate Beam_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n![References of compound beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645520ea7a1536663df28e41_WTS-Structure_23.06-2.png)\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the leftmost point of the beam. Consequently, the x-axis will run along the length of the beam with the y-axis perpendicular to it at the origin.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), change in [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads), and differences in the beam's [cross-sectional properties](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section). Starting from \\\\(A\\\\) and going toward the other end, we identify the following points of interest: \n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The fixed support and the start of the varying linear load of \\\\(60kN/m (4.11kip/ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(C(3.0m, 0.0m), C(9.84ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The location of the internal hinge.\n-   \\\\(D(4.5m, 0.0m), D(14.76ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The end of the varying linear load \\\\(0\\\\) and the start of the other varying linear load \\\\(0)\\\\), and\n-   \\\\(B(9.0m, 0.0m), B(29.53ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The end of the varying linear load of \\\\(30kN/m (2.06kip/ft)\\\\) and the roller support\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor a 2D beam, it is:\n\\\\(D=r-(3+e\\_c)\\\\)\nThis beam example have four reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(M\\_A\\\\), and \\\\(R\\_B\\\\), and one internal connection at joint \\\\(C\\\\) \\\\(e\\_c = 1\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=4-(3+1)=0\\\\)\nThe internal connection hinge at \\\\(C\\\\) provides an additional condition to help us analyze the structure. At the said point, _the moment experienced is zero_.\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-beam-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h, A\\_v, M\\_A, R\\_B\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the beam is externally stable. In terms of its internal stability, the beam arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Reaction analysis of compound beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645520f96dce1a4cdd90e782_WTS-Structure_23.06-3.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have four components:\n-   We assume \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the right, and \n-   \\\\(A\\_v\\\\) and \\\\(R\\_B\\\\) are acting upwards.\n-   \\\\(M\\_A\\\\) is a counterclockwise moment.\n##### Break Down the Beam\n![Compound beam broken down to its simpler parts](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6459124a4501f6832e653afd_WTS-Structure_CompoundBeam_001.png)\nAs a preliminary step in solving the reactions of compound beams, we \"disconnect\" it at points of internal connections. In our example, it would be the hinge at point \\\\(C\\\\). \nAs a result, we will have the free-body diagrams (FBD) of each element of the compound beam - FBD CB and FBD AC.\nFor each diagram, we have the joint \\\\(C\\\\). At this point, the hinge will provide two forces: \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_v\\\\), which are unknown.\nAt this hinge, it will provide an additional condition: the summation of moments at that point is zero. We can use this to help us solve the reactions.\nIn terms of its directions, \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_v\\\\) are also unknown. Normally, one assumes the direction. Said directions must be opposite for each FBD to comply with Newton's Third Law.\n-   In FBD CB, \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) acts to the right while \\\\(C\\_v\\\\) acts downward.\n-   In FBD AC, \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) acts to the left while \\\\(C\\_v\\\\) acts upward.\n![Ratio and proportion of uniform varying load wc](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645912635b04411016cb9b7a_WTS-Structure_CompoundBeam_002.png)\nBefore moving on, it would be wise to compute the load at point \\\\(C\\\\) for FBD CB.

Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn our example, we limit to shear and moment only.\n##### Modeling Shear and Moment Behavior\nWe can use shear and moment equations and graphs to describe the beam's internal behavior.\nCreating these equations and diagrams deserves a separate section. Learn more about how to construct these using these individual posts:\n-   [Shear and Moment Equations and Diagrams](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment)\n-   [Load, Shear, and Moment Relationships](/tree-posts/what-are-load-and-shear-relationships)\nThe following shows our beam's shear and moment equations and diagrams. _You can view the complete solution soon._\n###### Shear\n**SI Equations**\n\\\\(V\\_{AD}=\\frac{40}{6}x^{2}-60x+140.5,\\left\\\\{0\\le x\\le4.5\\right\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(V\\_{DB}=-\\frac{10}{3}x^{2}+30x-62,\\left\\\\{4.5\\le x\\le9\\right\\\\}\\\\)\n**Diagram**\n‍\n###### Moment\n**SI Equations**\n\\\\(M\\_{AD}=\\frac{40}{18}x^{3}-30x^{2}+140.5x-150.75,\\left\\\\{0\\le x\\le4.5\\right\\\\}\\\\)\n\\\\(M\\_{DB}=-\\frac{10}{9}x^{3}+15x^{2}-62x+153,\\left\\\\{4.5\\le x\\le9\\right\\\\}\\\\)\n**Diagram**\n‍\nIn the shear diagram, you'll see that we have a point of zero shear at \\\\(x= 5.785\\\\). At this point, it is a relative maximum. If you look at the moment diagram in the same position, it is where the maximum moment occurs \\\\(81.21 kN•m\\\\)\nIf you also look at the moment diagram, specifically at the point of the internal hinge, you'll see that the moment is zero, which verifies our internal connection condition.\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as the following:\n-   [Double Integration Method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-double-integration-method)\n-   [Area Moment Method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-area-moment-method)\n-   [Conjugate Beam Method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-conjugate-beam-method)\n-   [Work Methods](/tree-posts/introduction-to-work-methods)\n_The author will post the mathematical solution for this example soon. In the meantime, we can describe its deflection_ _[qualitatively](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflections-qualitatively)._\n-   The fixed support restricts the translation and rotation of the beam.\n-   The beam experiences a negative moment and concaves downward \\\\(0\\leq{x}\\leq1.5\\\\)\n-   The beam experiences a positive moment and concaves upward \\\\(1.5\\leq{x}\\leq9\\\\)\n-   At \\\\(x=1.5\\\\), it is where the point of inflection occurs (location of the hinge). The moment at this point is equal to zero.\n",

      "Free Content": "Let's recall that a structure comprises of different [components](/tree-posts/what-is-the-structural-model), such as supports, joints, and members. When modeling these, we must consider the positioning of these parts. We want it to have the proper arrangement. A building may suddenly collapse if we have poorly positioned these parts.\nTo guarantee a good arrangement, we first analyze the structure's stability before making any analysis. When we refer to stability, it is the ability to retain rigidity and shape when applied with loads.\nWhen do we say a structure is stable? It is such if it is both externally and internally stable. Let's discuss each type:\n## External Stability\nThis type deals with stability concerning the structure's supports. Let's consider that the model is a rigid body. To say it is externally stable, it must satisfy two things:\n### Proper Arrangement of Supports\n![Improper arrangement of supports](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea52297c1db5f79144ba1_WTS-Structure_19.1-1.png)\nThe first rule is to check if the [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) are in the correct position. Specifically, the action line must not be:\n1.  **Collinear.** Lines lie on the same line.\n2.  **Parallel.** Lines will never meet with each other.\n3.  **Concurrent.** Lines meet at a common point (known as the concurrency point).\nThese situations make the structure unstable because they cannot support specific load arrangements. For instance,\n-   When all support components lie on the same line, they cannot resist forces on a line perpendicular to the supports.\n-   When all support components are parallel, they cannot prevent the body from sliding.\n-   When all support components meet at a common point, they cannot resist any moment about the said point.\n#### Unstable Equilibrium\n![Examples of unstable equilibrium](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea52b204eb8b0db48bd0a_WTS-Structure_19.1-2.png)\nThere are unique instances when the structure can be stable even if the supports are collinear, parallel, or concurrent; however, these instances would require specific load arrangements:\n-   Collinear support can be stable if the applied loads are in equilibrium. In this arrangement, the reactions are optional.\n-   Parallel support can be stable if the applied loads are in the same direction as the reactions. In other words, the loads and supports form a parallel force system.\n-   Concurrent supports can be stable if the applied loads act at the concurrency point. When this happens, no overturning can happen at that point.\nEven if these special situations would stabilize a structure, these are still unstable. Civil buildings must be durable for any loads they may experience.\n### Number of Supports ≥ Number of Equilibrium Equations\n![Difference between insufficient and sufficient components](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642ea5402ec18c0cec4ba17e_WTS-Structure_19.1-3.png)\nThe second criterion is to check if the number of reaction components equals or exceeds the number of [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations.\nWhat happens if it is less than the number of equilibrium equations? Generally, we will be breaking such a key concept. Imagine two rollers supporting a 2D beam loaded with a diagonal load. If we use \\\\({\\sum}F\\_{x}=0\\\\) to evaluate it, we will NOT satisfy the equation because no support is resisting the horizontal component of the diagonal load. \nWe'll need something to resist such load to make it stable. Say we change one of the rollers to a hinge. In this instance, the hinge will help withstand the load.\nWe can have more than the required number of supports. Additional supports will provide more resistance and stabilize the building (provided that there is proper arrangement of supports).\n## Internal Stability\nThis type deals with a structure's stability concerning its arrangement and connections. Generally, this instability occurs when we have the following:\n-   Wrong location of internal connections, such as hinges or links,\n-   Wrong placement of members\nThese conditions will depend on the [type of structure](/tree-posts/investigating-the-fundamental-structures) which we will explore soon.\n## Summary\n> Stability is the structure's ability to retain rigidity and shape when applied with loads.\n> There are two types of stability: external and internal.\n> External stability deals with a structure's stability concerning its supports, while internal stability deals with a structure's stability concerning its arrangement and connections.\n> Two criteria must be satisfied to achieve external stability of a rigid-body structure. First, there must be a proper arrangement of supports - they should not be collinear, parallel, or concurrent, and (2) the number of reaction components must be equal to or greater than the number of equilibrium equations.\n> Analysis for internal stability will depend on the arrangement of the components.\n",

      "Free Content": "When dealing with [differential equations (DE)](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation), our primary goal is finding a solution to the DE.\n## What is a Solution?\nA solution is usually a [function](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) that would satisfy the DE. Aside from being a function, it is an expression free of math derivatives.\nTo illustrate, say we have a differential equation \\\\(y^\\prime – 2x = 0\\\\). The solution to this equation is \\\\(y = x^2 + C\\\\). Don't worry about how we got it; we will discuss the different methods to solve DE soon.\nWe determine that a solution solves the DE if it correctly evaluates back to the equation when plugged in.\nTo illustrate, let's evaluate the differential equation \\\\(y = x^2 + C\\\\). To do that, we substitute \\\\(y = x^2 + C\\\\) and its derivates to the original expression:\n-   \\\\(y^\\prime – 2x = 0\\\\)\n-   \\\\(2x - 2x = 0\\\\), the derivative of the solution \\\\(y = x^2 + C\\\\) is \\\\(y' = 2x\\\\)\n-   \\\\(0 = 0\\\\)\nIf the equality is correct, then the expression is a solution. In this case, it is.\nNow that we know what a solution is. It's time to discuss the two types of solutions: (1) general and (2) particular.\n## General Solution\n‍\nFor every differential equation, there is a general solution. Returning to \\\\(y' – 2x = 0\\\\), we say that the solution \\\\(y = x^2 + C\\\\) is its general solution.\nOne characteristic of general solutions is always having this arbitrary constant \\\\(C\\\\). This constant is similar to the constant of integration. We call it the general solution because this constant can be of any value. \nFor example, we assume multiple values of \\\\(C\\\\): 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., to the solution curve \\\\(y = x^2 + C\\\\). The solutions will be:\n-   \\\\(y = x^2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y = x^2+1\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y = x^2+2\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y = x^2+3\\\\)\nDespite having different expressions, these functions are solutions to the differential equation. We use \\\\(C\\\\) as a general placeholder to hold all these possible solutions to the DE.\nWe can plot these functions on a graph to see the solution curves to the differential equation. We sometimes call this collection of graphs the solution family curves.\n## Particular Solution\n‍\nWe call a solution particular if we are interested in a specific answer among the general solution curves. Usually, this happens if we have a condition.\nConsider the previous example; let's say we want a solution that satisfies the following criteria: variable \\\\(y\\\\) must be zero when \\\\(x\\\\) is 5. \nIf you solve for \\\\(C\\\\) using this information:\n-   \\\\(y = x^2+C\\\\)\n-   \\\\(0 = 5^2+C\\\\)\n-   \\\\(C=-25\\\\)\nSubstituting this \\\\(C\\\\) to the original solution, we'll have \\\\(y = x^2-25\\\\). This result is what we call a particular solution. It only exists if we have default values for its arbitrary constants.\nTo construct particular solutions, we must take a few notes:\n-   Conditions must consider a relationship between values. In our example, \\\\(y = 0\\\\) when \\\\(x = 5\\\\). \n-   The number of conditions must equal the number of arbitrary constants. For example, if you have three arbitrary constants, there must be three conditions.\n## Summary\n> When dealing with differential equations (DE), our primary goal is finding a solution to the DE.\n> A solution is usually a function that would satisfy the DE.

The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\n## Main Solution\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Sample Solution\nThe following section shows how to use the method of sections:\n#### Bar Forces BD, BC, and AC\n![Cut section along BD, BC, and AC](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ce133f44a76f30668f5e_WTS-Structure_21.06-1.png)\n##### Strategically Place the Cutting Plane\nWe start by placing a cutting plane through a maximum of three members. We do this because we can only apply three [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations for 2D trusses. It ensures we only have a maximum of three unknowns.\nAs a demonstration, let's solve internal bar forces \\\\(F\\_{BD}\\\\), \\\\(F\\_{BC}\\\\), and \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\). We place a cutting plane that will cut these members. It will divide the truss into two free-body diagrams (FBD), as shown. The cut members will have their internal forces exposed.\n##### All Parts of the Structure Must Be In Equilibrium\nSince we have divided the truss into two parts, we can choose either one or the other part to solve for bar forces \\\\(F\\_{BD}\\\\), \\\\(F\\_{BC}\\\\), and \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\). In this example, we'll choose the left-side part.\nLet's start by solving \\\\(F\\_{BD}\\\\). We do that by applying the moment equilibrium equation at \\\\(C\\\\) because it is at this point where bar forces \\\\(F\\_{BC}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\) will intersect. A moment at \\\\(C\\\\) will cancel these bar forces. Usually, this is the strategy for solving bar forces – find the point where two or more forces will meet and apply \\\\(\\sum M=0\\\\) at the intersection point to find the unknown bar force.\nAssuming all bar forces are in tension, we compute the bar forces:\n\\\\(\\sum{M}\\_C=0]\\circlearrowright\\_+\\\\)\n\\\\(6.33(3)+20(2.6)+F\\_{BD}(2.6)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{BD}=-27.3kN\\\\)\nWe can continue using other equilibrium equations to solve for the other bar forces.\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(6.33-F\\_{BC}\\sin60=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{BC}=7.31kN\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(7.31\\cos60+20+(-27.3)+F\\_{AC}-20=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AC}=23.65kN\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, we had the wrong assumed direction for said bar force. In this case, the direction of \\\\(F\\_{BD}\\\\) should be the other way around.\nPart of the analysis is also to know whether these axial forces are either tension \\\\(T\\\\) or compression \\\\(C\\\\). In this case, the two forces \\\\(F\\_{AC}\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_{BC}\\\\) cause their respective members to elongate; So, the internal bar forces in these members are in tension. If these two end forces cause the member to compress, such as \\\\(F\\_{BD}\\\\), it is a compressive force.\nWhen we finally solve for the unknowns, we can proceed to find another section and repeat the process.\n### Full Solution\nThis section shows the complete solution of the internal bar forces using the method of sections:\n#### Bar Force AB\n![Cut section along AB and AC](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ce1a1ddcb040bde52aad_WTS-Structure_21.06-2.png)\nLet's place a cut section through members \\\\(AB\\\\) and \\\\(AC\\\\) and choose the left side.

After analysis, it is always a good idea to summarise your results using a table.

      "Free Content": "One key component for [structural models](/tree-posts/what-is-the-structural-model) are supports. These are responsible for keeping objects restrained in space. Examples include building footing pads, guy wires, and even door hinges.\nThey have two primary purposes: (1) _they carry the applied structural loads_, and (2) _they control movement at the application point_ (We'll learn more about this in deflection later on.)\nLet's look at the hinge of a swinging door, for example. When you push it, you don't expect it to fall from its jamb; instead, it swings in or out. It is possible because the support hinges only permit swinging. This movement is how supports control the door's deflection. In addition to this, the hinges also carry the door's weight. Without these supports, nothing helps the door support on its own.\nHow much force the supports carry are what we call **_reactions_**. In structural analysis, finding these forces is a crucial part of a complete solution. We use reactions, for instance, in the design of supports.\n## How Do Loads Transfer to Supports?\nHow loads transfer to the supports is a complex topic - so many factors to consider if we want to mimic the actual behavior. For simplicity's sake, most analyses assume that the reactions can either be a **single resultant force** or its **components along axes**.\n## What are the Different Types of Support?\nThere are many support types - each has its function. For example, a door will require support that would carry its weight and permit swinging motion; a building will need something that would take its whole weight and make it stationary on the ground. We can describe the different types of supports based on these several properties:\n-   **Name.** The name of the support.\n-   **Symbol.** The support's figure in drawings or models.\n-   **Application Point.** The position of reaction forces. For example, it can be a nodal load acting through the center of the support or with an offset.\n-   **Number of Reactions.** The number of reaction forces.\n-   **Restraints.** The number of deflection restrictions.\nThere are two types of support depending on its construction: (1) external and (2) internal.\n### External Support\nSupports connected to the object are external supports. These are found either at the structure's ends or along its intermediary points.\nOut of all these supports, the most commonly used are the roller, the hinge, and the fixed support. In some references, the roller and hinge are sometimes collectively called simple supports.\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/641ec7550bbd0a0140f2b369_WTS-Structure_7-101-2DGrid.png)\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/641ec784c109c42e351430c6_WTS-Structure_7-102-3DGrid.png)\n### Internal Support\nInternal supports are built-in with the object they're supporting;  Example would be a hinge that acts as a connection for compound structures.\nThese supports provide additional equations to the structure, which we call _equations of condition or construction_. We'll see more of this as we go along the course.\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/641ec7550bbd0a0140f2b369_WTS-Structure_7-101-2DGrid.png)\n## **Summary**\n> Supports are responsible for keeping objects or structures restrained in space.\n> Supports have two primary purposes: (1) they must control movement at their application point, and (2) they must carry the applied external loads of the structure.\n> Reactions are forces associated with support. These carry the external loads of the structure.\n> We assume that reactions are represented either as a single resultant force or its components along axes.\n> There are many types of support - each has its function.\n> Supports connected to the structure are external supports, while those built-in with the object are internal supports.\n> The three most commonly used external supports are: (1) roller, (2) hinge, and (3) fixed support.\n> Internal supports provide additional equations called _equations of condition or construction_.\n",

      "Free Content": "Continuing from this [example](/tree-posts/how-to-perform-beam-analysis), let's learn how to use the [area moment method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-area-moment-method) to determine the [deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection) at critical points. We shall use moment-by-parts for this example. For the alternative solution, click [here](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-area-moment-method-using-integration).\n_The solution presented is in SI. The author will update the post soon to reflect English units._\nIn this example, we are to find the deflection components at all critical points of the beam - \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\). It includes the slope and horizontal and vertical deflection components of said points. At the end of the solution, we have to show a deflection matrix - a table showing the deflection at each critical location.\n![Double overhang beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457850fd7bce4362016d0e4_WTS-Structure_28.1-2-3-1.png)\n## Inspection Analysis\nLet's identify the number of deflection components we need to solve. In a 2D structure, there are at most three per joint (rotation, horizontal translation, vertical translation). With five joints, we have a total of 15 components.\nFrom inspection, we can already solve the value of some components: \nSince no horizontal loads are acting on the beam that causes it to move along the x-axis, horizontal translation at all critical points is zero (5 inspected, ten remaining)\nVertical movement at supports is not allowed at \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\); hence, vertical translation at these points is also zero (7 inspected, eight remaining)\nFrom 15 components, we would need to solve only 8 using the area moment method.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Main Solution\n### Draw Moment Diagram By Parts\nThe first step is to create the moment diagram of our example by superimposing the bending effects of cantilever parts. This [article](/tree-posts/what-is-moment-by-parts) shows a more descriptive discussion of how to construct one.\n### Set Up M/EI Expressions\nAfter getting the moment diagram by parts, we set up the \\\\(M/EI\\\\) expressions per segment. We divide the said moment diagram \\\\(M\\\\) [equation](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment) with the flexural [rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) of the beam \\\\(EI\\\\).\n### Sketch the Deflected Shape\n![Approximate deflected shape of the beam example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a0cd3091d563955f8787_WTS-Structure_29.3-4-2.png)\nThe next step is to draw an approximate deflected shape of the structure. Our basis in sketching is the structure's [compatibility](/tree-posts/what-are-compatibility-conditions) requirements and [support](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) conditions.\nThis approximate sketch will be our basis for deriving the critical relationships for the deflection components required.\nPart of sketching is also assigning a sign convention to all our deflection components based on our drawing:\n-   If translation \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) is upward from the longitudinal axis (+x-axis), it has a positive sense. Otherwise, it is negative. \n-   If rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is counterclockwise from the longitudinal axis (+x-axis), it has a positive sense. Otherwise, it is negative.\nFrom these conventions, translations \\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\\\) is positive while \\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\\\) and \\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\\\) are negative. For rotations, \\\\(\\theta\\_C\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_D\\\\), and \\\\(\\theta\\_E\\\\) are positive while \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\), and \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) are negative.\nLater on, we can verify if these signs are indeed correct.\n### Derive Key Relationships\n![Key relationships among deflection and deviation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a0ead7bce4108418ba69_WTS-Structure_29.3-4-3.png)\nNext, we derive relationships for all deflection components based on our sketch.\nLike our first approach, we draw a reference tangent at one of the supports (at \\\\(B\\\\)). Then, draw and label all translations \\\\(\\Delta\\\\), rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\), and deviations \\\\(t\\\\). Afterward, we identify similar triangles in our drawing, which will be our basis for forming relationships\n#### Translation\nFrom triangles \\\\(BAA^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(BCC^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(BDD^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), and \\\\(BEE^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), we can derive the following:\nEquation 1-1: \\\\(\\frac{A A^{\\prime \\prime}}{2}=\\frac{C C^{\\prime \\prime}}{4.5}=\\frac{D D^{\\prime \\prime}}{9}=\\frac{E E^{\\prime \\prime}}{10.5}\\\\)\nFrom the same figure, we can express \\\\(AA^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(CC^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(DD^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), and \\\\(EE^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) the following:\nEquation 1-2: \\\\(A A^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(+\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\right)-\\left(+t\\_{A / B}\\right)\\\\)\nEquation 1-3: \\\\(C C^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(-\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{C / B}\\right)\\\\)\nEquation 1-4: \\\\(D D^{\\prime \\prime}=+t\\_{D / B}\\\\)\nEquation 1-5: \\\\(E E^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left(+t\\_{E / B}\\right)-\\left(+\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\right)\\\\)\nWe shall use these equations to solve for the translations after we get the values for deviation.\n#### Rotation\nIf we look at triangle \\\\(BDD^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), we can also derive a relationship for the clockwise rotation at \\\\(B\\\\):\nEquation 2-1: \\\\(-\\theta\\_B=-\\frac{D D^{\\prime \\prime}}{9}=-\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}\\\\)\nLater on, we shall use the [first theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-change-in-slope-in-the-area-moment-method) to get other rotational components; hence, there is no need to derive relationships further for other angular deflections.\n### Solve for Deviations\nAfter formulating relationships among deviations and deflections, it's time to solve for deviations \\\\(t\\\\) of Equations 1-2 to 1-5.\nWe apply the [second theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-tangential-deviation) to solve for tangential deviations among \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\). We will use moment by parts \\\\(M/EI\\\\) for this approach.\nLet's compute for \\\\(t\\_{A/B}\\\\), \\\\(t\\_{C/B}\\\\), \\\\(t\\_{D/B}\\\\), and \\\\(t\\_{E/B}\\\\):\n\\\\(t\\_{A / B}=\\frac{1}{E I}(2 \\times 27)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2\\right)=\\frac{54}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{C / B}=\\frac{1}{E I}[\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 405\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4.5\\right)+(4.5 \\times 27)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.5 \\times 151.875\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5} \\times 4.5\\right)]=\\frac{1486.48}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{D / B}=\\frac{1}{E I}[(4.5 \\times 27)\\left(\\frac{4.5}{2}+4.5\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 405\\right)\\left(\\frac{4.5}{3}+4.5\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.5 \\times 151.875\\right)\\left(\\frac{4.5}{5}+4.5\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(-\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4.5 \\times 364.5\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{4} \\times 4.5\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 1184.625\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 4.5\\right)-(4.5 \\times 135)\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(-\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5\\right)(540-135)\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 4.5\\right)]=\\frac{474579}{64 E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{E / B}=\\frac{1}{E I}[(4.5 \\times 27)\\left(\\frac{4.5}{2}+6\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 405\\right)\\left(\\frac{4.5}{3}+6\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.5 \\times 151.875\\right)\\left(\\frac{4.5}{5}+6\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(-\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4.5 \\times 364.5\\right)\\left(\\frac{3 \\times 4.5}{4}+1.5\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 1184.625\\right)\\left(\\frac{2 \\times 4.5}{3}+1.5\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}(6 \\times 540)\\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6\\right)]\\\\)\n\\\\(t\\_{E / B}=\\frac{9506.74}{E I}\\\\)\nAfter solving for the deviations, we interpret our results. Since our answers are positive, this indicates that \\\\(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(C^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), \\\\(D^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\), and \\\\(E^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) must be above the reference tangent. Comparing these results with our drawing, it matches our sketch. If it doesn't, we may need to resketch and reformulate our relationships in the previous step.\n### Solve for Deflection Components\nWe can now compute for the deflection components with deviations solved using our earlier derived relationships.\n#### Translation\nUsing Equations 1–1 to 1–5, let's solve for \\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\\\), \\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\\\), and \\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\\\):\n\\\\(\\frac{\\left(+\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}\\right)-\\left(+t\\_{A / B}\\right)}{2}=\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}=\\frac{2}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}+\\frac{54}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{A\\_v}=\\frac{1701.84}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{\\left(-\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}\\right)+\\left(+t\\_{C / B}\\right)}{4.5}=\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}=-\\left(\\frac{4.5}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}-\\frac{1486.48}{E I}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{C\\_v}=-\\frac{2221.18}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{t\\_{D / B}}{9}=\\frac{\\left(+t\\_{E / B}\\right)-\\left(+\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\right)}{10.5}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=\\left(\\frac{9506.74}{E I}-\\frac{10.5}{9} \\times \\frac{474579}{64 E I}\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=\\frac{855.62}{E I}\\\\)\nWith translations solved, we verify the positioning of these translations and compare it with our sketch. \nTranslation at \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\) is positive, which means that \\\\(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) and \\\\(E^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) is above the +x-axis. On the other hand, \\\\(C\\\\) is negative, indicating that \\\\(C^{\\prime \\prime}\\\\) is below the +x-axis. These results confirm the accuracy of our sketch, and we may proceed with solving for the rotational components.\nAgain, if our answers do not conform to our initial sketch - meaning the signs of the results are opposite to that of our drawing, then we have the wrong sign assumption. The actual direction would be the opposite of what we have established.\n#### Rotation\nWith translations solved, the only remaining thing to do is to solve for \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_C\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_D\\\\), and \\\\(\\theta\\_E\\\\). With \\\\(t\\_{D/B}\\\\) solved, we can use Equation 2-1 to find the rotation at \\\\(B\\\\):\n\\\\(-\\theta\\_B=-\\frac{474579}{9 \\times 64 E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(-\\theta\\_B=-\\frac{823.92}{E I}\\\\)\nBefore solving for the other rotations, verify if the direction of \\\\(B\\\\) is clockwise by checking whether the corrected translations match. If it doesn't, we must change the sign to positive to indicate that the direction is counterclockwise.\nAfter verifying, we use the [first theorem](/tree-posts/what-is-change-in-slope-in-the-area-moment-method) of the area moment method to solve for the remaining rotations. Rather than using integration, we use the moment-by-parts diagram again. With \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) as our reference, let's first solve \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\):\n\\\\(\\theta\\_B-\\theta\\_A=\\frac{1}{E I}(4.5 \\times 27)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_A=-\\frac{823.92}{E I}-\\frac{54}{E I}=-\\frac{877.9}{E I}\\\\)\nWith \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\) solved, let’s compute for the remaining rotations using \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) as reference again:\n\\\\(\\theta\\_C-\\theta\\_B=\\frac{1}{E I}\\left[\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 405\\right)+(4.5 \\times 27)-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.5 \\times 151.875\\right)\\right]\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_C=\\frac{861.89}{E I}-\\frac{823.92}{E I}=\\frac{37.8}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_D-\\theta\\_B=\\frac{1}{E I}[\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 405\\right)+(4.5 \\times 27)-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.5 \\times 151.875\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4.5 \\times 364.5\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 1184.625\\right)-(4.5 \\times 135)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5\\right)(540-135)]\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_D=\\frac{1461.80}{E I}-\\frac{823.92}{E I}=\\frac{637.9}{E I}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_E-\\theta\\_B=\\frac{1}{E I}[\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 405\\right)+(4.5 \\times 27)-\\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times 4.5 \\times 151.875\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4.5 \\times 364.5\\right)\\\\)\n\\\\(+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4.5 \\times 1184.625\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 \\times 540\\right)]\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_E=\\frac{1360.55}{E I}-\\frac{823.92}{E I}=\\frac{536.6}{E I}\\\\)\nAfter solving for the rotations, we interpret the results. \\\\(\\theta\\_A\\\\) and \\\\(\\theta\\_B\\\\) are negative, which means the rotation is clockwise, while \\\\(\\theta\\_C\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\_D\\\\), and \\\\(\\theta\\_E\\\\) are positive indicating a counterclockwise rotation.\n### Deflection Matrix\n‍\nAt this point, we have solved all 15 deflection components. It is best to summarise all our results using a deflection matrix. The sign convention described in the table is as follows:\n-   A positive-sense rotation means that the point rotated counterclockwise from the local longitudinal axis (+x-axis), while negative means the opposite.\n-   A positive-sense translation means the point deflected upward from the local longitudinal axis (+x-axis), while negative means the opposite.\n",

      "Free Content": "After [modeling the structure](/tree-posts/structural-modeling), the next step is to analyze the forces the building may experience. We now move on to the topic of structural loads:\n## Structural Loads\n![Definition of structural loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e57f1ba967928cb5945c0_WTS-Structure_11-1.png)\nStructural loads are forces that cause stress and deformations to structures.\nThe study of loads is critical when designing structures. One must adequately identify the loads one will experience during its lifetime. Engineers must anticipate these and find ways to resist these loads; hence, these forces will dictate the design, like choosing the right section for parts of the building and the materials used.\nTo begin understanding loads, we answer these questions:\n## Where Do Loads Originate?\n[Loads come from different sources.](/tree-posts/where-do-loads-come-from) Some loads come from the interaction between the building and the environment. Other loads come from how we use it.\nFrom these different sources, a structure will experience different [types of loads](/tree-posts/what-are-the-types-of-structural-loads). To name a few, it may be:\n-   The weight of the building itself (dead loads)\n-   How people occupy the structure (live loads)\n-   The effects of wind and earthquake phenomena (wind and seismic loads)\n## How Do Loads Behave?\nLoads [behave in different ways](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads) depending on the type. It can vary in a lot of ways:\n-   [Spatial application](/tree-posts/how-do-loads-apply-on-a-structure) refers to the area in space the load is applied.\n-   Load duration tells us its period acting on a structure.\n-   Nature refers to the static or dynamic nature of the force.\n-   The rate of application refers to how nature applies the load to the structure.\n-   Load certainty refers to the probability that the force will occur.\n## How To Compute For The Loads?\nComputing for loads will depend on the structural codes used. The standards will depend on the prevailing regulations within the region. There are countless building code references. Examples of these include:\n-   Uniform Building Code\n-   International Building Code\n-   American Society of Civil Engineers\n-   American Concrete Institute\n-   American Institute of Steel Construction\n-   National Building Code of Canada\n-   British Standards Institute\n-   Eurocode\n-   Indian Standard (IS) Code\nMultiple approaches and guidelines exist for computing dead, live, wind, and seismic loads with different behavior. Most of these references already provide values one can use; therefore, one should consult these references when determining the loads of the structure. \n## How Do We Use These Loads In Design?\nAfter computing the loads, we can use these in designing structures. One can already create a design from dead, live, or any other type of load by itself; however, that is only sometimes the case.\nDepending on the design philosophy, we need to compute for load combinations - a load combining different force types (dead, live, etc.). This combination is what we apply to the structure; these are to simulate real-life loading scenarios. For example: \n-   We can combine dead, live, and seismic loads to simulate an earthquake hitting a building with people inside.\n-   We can combine dead, live, and wind loads to simulate a typhoon hitting a house with residents inside.\nWe can obtain many types of possible combinations out of these varieties. We use these to get the worst-case loading scenario and receive the highest potential force or stress a member may encounter. When we design a component using these values, we ensure that our design can resist these worst scenarios.\n## Summary\n> Structural loads are forces that cause stress and deformations to structures.\n> The study of loads is critical when designing structures. One must adequately identify the loads one will experience during its lifetime. \n> Loads come from different sources. Some loads come from the interaction between the building and the environment.

      "Free Content": "\"Integral\" means \"to make whole or complete.\" That's precisely what the idea of integration is doing. In this post, we'll explore the essence behind this operation.\n## Elementary Geometry is Limited\n![Elementary geometry is limited](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35d167b1940112c4a07a7_WTS-1-Mathematics_MeaningBehindIntegration-1.png)\nTo understand the meaning of an integral, we have to look at what it is trying to solve in the first place.\nSay we have the following geometric problems:\n-   Find the length of a line between two points.\n-   Find the area of a typical section, like a closed rectangle\n-   Find the volume of a solid with a known cross-sectional shape, like that of a cylinder.\nTypically, we can solve these problems using analytic or solid geometry principles. To solve the math problems above:\n-   We use the distance formula to solve the distance between two points along a line. \n-   If we want to solve the area, we solve using pre-defined equations in geometry. In our closed rectangle, it would be base times height.\n-   If we want to solve for the volume, we use Cavalieri's theorem to get it.\nAs much as these ideas help us find an answer, there is a problem. These solutions are limited. They do not encompass a wide variety of situations we may face. For example, we may encounter the following issues too:\n-   Find the length of a curve, say a curved portion or an arc.\n-   Find the area underneath a curve boundary\n-   Find the volume of a solid with an irregular cross-sectional shape.\nFrom these problems, we can already see the limitations of our pre-defined formulas and equations. We cannot simply use the distance, area, or volume formulas to arrive at an answer. \nThe best thing we can do in using Elementary geometry is to approximate an answer. \n## Approximating a Solution\n![Approximating a solution](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35d3018c30a32410fb590_WTS-1-Mathematics_MeaningBehindIntegration-2.png)\nHow do we approximate a solution? We subdivide the object into many recognizable parts and then take the sum of each division. In our problems:\n-   We can divide the curve into multiple lines and solve each using the distance formula. Afterward, we take the sum of each line to get an answer.\n-   We split the area underneath the curve boundary into many parts, say multiple rectangles. We solve the area of each rectangle, then take the sum to get the total area.\n-   We subdivide the volume into numerous solids. Solve for the volume of each division, then sum each part to get the solid's volume.\n## How Do We Find the Exact Solution?\nWhen we approximate by this method, we can have some idea of the answer is; It is an excellent method to gain a ballpark, but again, it is only an approximation. How do we find the precise solution to the problem?\nLet's discuss what does affect the approximation's accuracy:\n-   The shape of the division\n-   The number of divisions \n-   The size of the divisions\nTaking our length of an arc example, we can have a more precise answer if we have more line divisions with consistent length. Having more parts will mean smaller dimensions each.\nIf we want to find the exact answer, the dimensions of these parts will have to be small. In Math, we can represent these small changes: the differential.\nThis differential represents the infinite and tiny divisions of our approximation.\n## The Meaning Behind the Integral\n![The meaning behind integration](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35d445e368896235c40ad_WTS-1-Mathematics_MeaningBehindIntegration-3.png)\nNow that we have a differential part, we can find the correct answer to our geometric problems. What's left is to take the sum of all differentials just like we did with the approximation process. But how do we exactly do that?\nThat's where integration comes in. It's a process where we find the whole from the parts.\nWith this idea, integration breaks the limitations of Elementary geometry. We can solve a wide array of geometric problems when using integration.\nIn the following sections, we'll explore how to use it to find:\n-   [The length of any curve](/tree-posts/how-to-find-the-arc-of-a-curve-using-integration)\n-   [The area beneath the curves](/tree-posts/solving-area-by-integration)\n-   [The volume of different types of solids](/tree-posts/solving-volume-by-integration)\n## Summary\n> Elementary geometry solutions are great for solving different problems but are limited.\n> Usually, when facing a geometric problem outside its limits, we can only approximate it.\n> We approximate by taking the object and dividing it into many recognizable parts we can solve using Elementary geometry.\n> The approximation becomes better if the divisions are infinite and tiny, which we represent using differentials.\n> We take the sum of these differentials through integration - \"the process of finding the whole from many parts.\"\n",

Or a circle? There is no limitation when we create a cross-section:\n-   One could build a T-shaped section by stacking a horizontal rectangle on top of a vertical one.\n-   One could make a cross-section with holes like square tubes or open pipes.\n![Examples of members with different cross-sections.](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e55532f2cd5abc4ac7239_WTS-Structure_5.2-1.png)\n## Shape Properties\nThere are several essential properties when discussing the member's shape.\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Symmetry\n![Difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e555b3e207bcc51731363_WTS-Structure_5.2-2.png)\nSymmetry is a measure of how similar something is to an axis.\n#### Symmetrical Shape\nWhen a shape is said to be symmetric, we can place a line to split the section into two mirrored parts. A perfect example is a circle. Let the axes of this shape originate at its center. If we fold it along any of its axes, we will have two mirrored half-circles.\n#### Asymmetrical Shape\nOn the other hand, a shape is asymmetric if a line fails to split the cross-section into mirrored parts. A great example is a scalene triangle - no matter what orientation we place the axes of the cross-section, we won't find a position that will divide it into mirrored parts.\n#### Shapes Can Be Both\nIt is noteworthy that shapes can be symmetric and, at the same time, the opposite. Let's take a T-member and consider its cross-section. When we fold along the \\\\(y\\\\)-axis, we can say that it's symmetric; however, when we fold along the \\\\(x\\\\)-axis, it's asymmetric.\n### Single and Built-Up Sections\n![Examples of single and built-up sections](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/642e55622db706ca29f9fda2_WTS-Structure_5.2-3.png)\nOne can build the shape of a structural member with multiple combined members. For example, one can combine a single steel angle bar with another to create a double back-to-back angle bar. A shape built this way is a built-up section.\nThere are many reasons these sections are preferred: to increase a member's strength or for cost-control.\n## Summary\n> The shape of the member refers to the cut surface of its cross-section.\n> Symmetry is a measure of how similar something is to an axis.\n> The shape of the cross-section can be symmetric or asymmetric. A cross-section is the former if we can place a line to split it into two mirrored parts. Otherwise, it is the latter.\n> The shape of a member can either be single or built up.\n",

      "Free Content": "The [cantilever beam](/tree-posts/what-are-common-beam-types) is a structure most structural engineers will commonly see. This post extensively discusses this structure. We'll discuss it in four parts: (1) [model](/tree-posts/what-is-the-structural-model), (2) [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads), (3) [analysis](/tree-posts/structural-analysis), and (4) design.\n## Model\n![Cantilever Beam - Model](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551bb47fecad18f0e70b3a_WTS-Structure_23.008-1.png)\nWe first start discussing its model. The cantilever beam is a structure of definite length with the following properties:\n-   It has only one [fixed-end support](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports) on one end\n-   Its other end is free\nFrom its model, the beam only has one support. As a result of such a model, it is a [determinate](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures) structure.\nIn terms of its [properties](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member), it can be of any length, shape, or material. These properties would entirely depend on the cantilever beam's purpose.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Loads\n![Cantilever Beam - Loads](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551bbbb2a764e82930f12c_WTS-Structure_23.008-2.png)\nNext, we discuss the loads that will be applied. \nWhen referring to a cantilever, we associate it with a beam designed to withstand flexural loads - forces that act perpendicular to the beam's longitudinal axis.\nThese loads can be a [moment, concentrated load, uniform, or varying loads](/tree-posts/how-do-loads-apply-on-a-structure) of different magnitudes and directions.\nThe beam may experience other loads other than the flexural type. We can apply axial or torsional loads on it. It is possible to have a combination of these types.\n## Analysis\nLet's move on to a typical analysis of a cantilever beam.\nWe will analyze all four aspects: stability, reactions, internal forces, and deflection.\n### Stability\nLet's start with its [stability](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-geometric-stability). A structure is stable if it is both externally and internally stable:\n-   The supports are NOT collinear, concurrent, or parallel.\n-   The beam's determinacy is zero.\n-   The member is well arranged. There are also no internal devices that may compromise its stability.\n### Reactions\n![Cantilever Beam - Reactions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551bc4038cbb7c8be86419_WTS-Structure_23.008-3.png)\nLet's now talk about the cantilever beam's reactions.\nAs we have seen earlier, only one fixed-end support carries the entire member. This plane fixed support has three reaction components: (1) horizontal force component, (2) vertical force component, and (3) moment component.\nWe can solve these quickly. Since it is a determinate structure, we can solve this by applying the [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) concept.\n### Internal Forces and Stresses\n![Cantilever Beam - Internal Forces and Stresses](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551bcbf960002061a85a3e_WTS-Structure_23.008-4.png)\n#### Shear\nThe cantilever's shear has the following typical properties:\n-   The shear at its free end is usually zero. \n-   The vertical reaction at its fixed-end support is usually the maximum shear.\nIt is essential to note that these properties are only sometimes accurate. Again, it would depend on the beam's loading conditions.\n#### Moment\nThe beam's moment will depend on the loads; however, we can observe a fascinating pattern regarding its moment behavior. Using these patterns, we can efficiently compute its area and center of the moment graph (provided it matches the loading condition)—more on this at this [link](/tree-posts/how-to-get-the-area-and-centroid-of-cantilever-moment-diagrams-easily).\n### Deflection\n![Cantilever Beam - Deflection](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551bd47a9bfb80fb5845b7_WTS-Structure_23.008-5.png)\nLastly, we'll discuss the beam's [deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection) - a measure of its movement from its original shape.\nAssuming we have \\\\(P\\\\) or \\\\(w\\\\) loads acting in one direction, the typical deflection is the following:\n-   No deflection at its fixed end (as per support requirements)\n-   The maximum deflection is usually at its free end.\nAgain, this is sometimes true. It would entirely depend on the loading condition of the beam.\n### Rotation and Translation\nLike the beam's moment, there is an interesting pattern when observing its rotation and translation, especially at its free end—more at this [link](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-cantilever-deflection-easily).\n## Design\nFinally, let's discuss some key aspects of a cantilever's design.\nLet's recall that a structure's design depends on many factors, such as its purpose, design philosophy, costs, and logistics, to name a few.\nDespite these factors, there are some general remarks we can take note of when designing a cantilever. Below are some of them:\n-   Usually, the longer it is, the bigger or thicker its size.\n-   The fixed-ended support should be strong enough since it is the only support of the beam.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> The cantilever beam is a structure most structural engineers will commonly see.\n> The cantilever beam is a structure of definite length with the following properties (1) it has only one fixed-end support on one end, and (2) its other end is free.\n> It is a determinate structure.\n> In terms of its properties, it can be of any length, shape, or material. \n> When referring to a cantilever, we associate it with a beam designed to withstand flexural loads.\n> It is naturally stable because (1) the supports are NOT collinear, concurrent, or parallel, (2) the beam's determinacy is zero, and (3) there are also no internal devices that may compromise its stability.\n> Only one fixed-end support carries the entire member.

This new method is an analytical procedure in which solving deflections is similar to finding a structure's [shear and moment](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment). Many references say that this procedure expands the area moment method.\nOne drawback of the area moment method is relying on the structure's deflected shape in deriving relationships among deflections. The conjugate beam method resolves this issue.\n## What is the Conjugate Beam?\n![Real and conjugate beam](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a1a9e0dceba4d25eabfe_WTS-Structure_30-1.png)\nLet's start by investigating a simple [beam](/tree-posts/what-is-a-beam) \\\\(AB\\\\) loaded with a uniform distributed load \\\\(w\\\\).\nAny Strength of Materials topic will tell you that there is a [relationship between load, shear, and moment](/tree-posts/what-are-load-shear-and-moment-relationships):\nLoad: \\\\(\\frac{d^2M}{dx^2}=w\\space(load)\\\\)\nShear: \\\\(\\frac{dM}{dx}=V\\space(shear)\\\\)\nMoment: \\\\(M=(moment)\\\\)\nA primary application of these equations is that you can model \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) without deriving the shear and moment equations per segment. For example, if we want to get the moment at \\\\(B\\\\) (assuming we know the moment at \\\\(A\\\\)), we get the area of the shear diagram from \\\\(A\\\\) to \\\\(B\\\\) and add it to the moment at \\\\(A\\\\).\nThe figure shows the whole shear and moment diagram of our beam example.\nMoving on, we also have discussed the [Bernoulli-Euler Beam Equation](/tree-posts/what-is-the-bernoulli-euler-beam-theory) and how integrating it twice will lead us to solve for deflection components:\n\\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\): \\\\(\\frac{d^2\\Delta}{dx^2}=\\frac{M}{EI}\\space(moment/EI)\\\\)\nRotation: \\\\(\\frac{d\\Delta}{dx}=\\frac{\\theta}{EI}\\space(rotation)\\\\)\nTranslation: \\\\(\\frac{\\Delta}{EI}=(translation)\\\\)\nThis set of relationships heavily implies that \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\), \\\\(\\theta\\\\), and \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) are connected.\nIf you make a comparison between these two sets of equations, you'll notice that there is parallelism:\n-   Load is similar to \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\).\n-   Shear is similar to the rotation.\n-   The moment is similar to deflection.\nIf there is an analogy between the two sets, we can adopt a similar solution, just like the first set. That is, solving for deflection is the same as finding the shear and moment of a beam. To do that, we create a structure similar to its counterpart called the conjugate beam.\nConstructing the conjugate beam is straightforward:\n-   The length of the conjugate beam is similar to that of the actual beam.\n-   To maintain the analogy between the two sets of equations, we treat the \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\)-diagram as a fictional load applied to the conjugate beam.\n-   We must introduce artificial constraints for specific beams like overhangs and cantilevers (more at this [post](/tree-posts/what-are-artificial-constraints)).\nWe shift our focus first on the conjugate beam theorems.\n## Key Idea: Conjugate Beam Theorems\nHow do we exactly solve for deflection using this method? To answer, let's discuss the method's two theorems based on our earlier analogies:\n### Theorem 1: Conjugate Shear is Real Rotation\n![Conjugate Beam Theorems: Conjugate Shear is Real Rotation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a1c1d7bce44bb518c50d_WTS-Structure_30-2.png)\nThe first theorem deals with finding rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\) at a specific point. It states that: the fictional shear of the conjugate beam at any point is the rotation (slope) of the actual beam at said point.\n\\\\(V^{\\prime}=\\theta\\\\)\nLearn more about this theorem using this [link](/tree-posts/what-is-conjugate-shear).\n### Theorem 2: Conjugate Moment is Real Translation\n![Conjugate Beam Theorems: Conjugate Moment is Real Translation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a1d5f52e17b93f91b14c_WTS-Structure_30-3.png)\nIf the first theorem deals with rotation \\\\(\\theta\\\\), then the second theorem deals with translation \\\\(\\Delta\\\\). It states that: the fictional moment of the conjugate beam at any point is the translation (slope) of the actual beam at said point.\n\\\\(M^{\\prime}=\\Delta\\\\)\nLearn more about this theorem using this [link](/tree-posts/what-is-conjugate-moment).\n## Using the Conjugate Beam Method\nThe conjugate beam method is straightforward. We'll use an illustrative [example](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-conjugate-beam-method) to show how it works.\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> The conjugate beam method is an analytical procedure in which solving deflections is similar to finding a structure's shear and moment. It is an expansion of the area moment method.\n> It revolves around making an analogy between the actual beam, and its conjugate counterpart: (1) load is similar to \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\), (2) shear is similar to the rotation, and (3) the moment is similar to deflection.\n> Constructing the conjugate beam is straightforward: (1) The length of the conjugate beam is similar to that of the actual beam, (2) To maintain the analogy between the two sets of equations, we treat the \\\\(\\frac{M}{EI}\\\\)-diagram as a fictional load applied to the conjugate beam, (3) We must introduce artificial constraints for specific beams like overhangs and cantilevers (more on this later).\n> Two theorems are needed to solve deflections using this method: (1) conjugate shear is actual rotation, and (2) conjugate moment is actual translation.\n> The first theorem states that: the fictional shear of the conjugate beam at any point is the rotation (slope) of the actual beam at said point.\n> The second theorem states that: The fictional moment of the conjugate beam at any point is the translation (slope) of the actual beam at said point.\n",

      "Paid Content": "### Numerical Perspective\nWe can observe a fascinating property when we create a table of values for polynomial functions and evaluate their differences. Let's consider two functions:\n-   \\\\(f(x)=x^3+x^2+x+5\\\\) - a cubic function (degree 3)\n-   \\\\(f(x)=x+1\\\\) - a linear function (degree 1)\nLet's create a table of values for each and try evaluating the outputs given -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2 as inputs. Afterward, we take the difference between adjacent output values until we reach a point where the differences are the same. \n![Numerical perspective of polynomial functions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35f061e0200d86c9a8a5f_WTS-1-Mathematics_Polynomial Functions-1.png)\nObserve that:\n-   For the cubic function, it will take you three differences\n-   For a linear function, it will only take you one difference\nThe number of times we must take the difference between adjacent values to reach a common difference equals the polynomial degree of the function.\n### Graphical Perspective\nPolynomial functions have interesting graphical properties. Below is a table of \\\\(n\\\\) polynomial functions with their graphs. Here are some notable illustrations one can take off when analyzing their plots:\n-   The graph of a constant function is a horizontal line\n-   The graph of a linear function is a line\n-   The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola\n‍\n#### Transformations\nWe can make different transformations to the graphs of polynomial functions. For example, we can move it or create a mirror of it. The following section shows how we apply these transformations. \nLet's consider a quadratic function: \\\\(f(x)=x^2\\\\). The graph is a parabola with its vertex at the origin \\\\((0,0)\\\\)\n##### Translation\n###### Horizontal\n‍\nSay we want to translate our quadratic function to the left or right. We introduce a constant \\\\(c\\\\) to the input \\\\(f(x±c)\\\\) to accomplish this.\n-   The graph moves to the right if \\\\(c\\\\) is negative.\n-   It moves to the left if \\\\(c\\\\) is positive.\nLet's move our graph example one unit horizontally. The possible expressions would be the following:\n-   If we have \\\\(f(x)=(x+1)^2\\\\), the graph will translate three units to the left.\n-   If we have \\\\(f(x)=(x-1)^2\\\\), it will translate three units to the right.\n###### Vertical\n‍\nLet's consider the translation of our graph in up or down directions. Again, we introduce a constant \\\\(c\\\\) that we will add to the polynomial function: \\\\(f(x)±c\\\\)\n-   The graph moves upward if \\\\(c\\\\) is positive.\n-   It moves downward if \\\\(c\\\\) is negative.\nLet's move our graph example one unit vertically. The possible expressions would be the following:\n-   If we have \\\\(f(x)=(x)^2+1\\\\), the graph will translate three units upward.\n-   If we have \\\\(f(x)=(x)^2-1\\\\), it will translate three units downward.\nFrom this \\\\(c\\\\), we can make an additional observation: the constant term of the polynomial function dictates the vertical movement of the graph.\n##### Reflection\n‍\nReflection deals with a graph's mirror transformation (or symmetry) about a particular line. We consider the signs to investigate this transformation.\n-   \\\\(f(-x)\\\\) will reflect the graph about the y-axis.\n-   \\\\(-f(x)\\\\) will reflect the graph about the x-axis.\n-   \\\\(-f(-x)\\\\) will reflect the graph about the origin.\nTo have a better view, let's consider another function, \\\\(f\\left(x\\right)=x^{3}+x^{4}\\\\). The following are the possible reflection transformations of the graph:\n-   If we have \\\\(f\\left(x\\right)=\\left(-x\\right)^{3}+\\left(-x\\right)^{4}\\\\), we will reflect the graph about the y-axis. See \\\\(g(x)\\\\)\n-   If we have \\\\(f\\left(x\\right)=-\\left(x^{3}+x^{4}\\right)\\\\), we will reflect the graph about the x-axis. See \\\\(h(x)\\\\)\n-   If we have \\\\(f\\left(x\\right)=-\\left(\\left(-x\\right)^{3}+\\left(-x\\right)^{4}\\right)\\\\), we will reflect the graph about the origin. See \\\\(i(x)\\\\)\nThese are some sample transformation methods we use to modify the graph of a function. We can combine different transformations to create plots that would suit our needs.\n## Summary\n> If a polynomial is in terms of a function, it is a polynomial function.\n> We can express the general form of a polynomial function as: \\\\(f(x)=a\\_n x^n+a\\_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a\\_2 x^2+a\\_1 x+a\\_0\\\\)\n> When dealing with such functions, we usually define them by the degree of the polynomial \\\\(n\\\\).\n> Numerically speaking, the number of times we must take the difference between adjacent outputs to reach a common difference equals the polynomial degree \\\\(n\\\\).\n> Polynomial functions have interesting graphical properties.

      "Free Content": "We expand more of our knowledge of mathematical [functions](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) by discussing their notation - our way of naming it. Typically, we make use of mathematical symbols and expressions. \nThe goal of analytical notation is to simplify how we express it. It may be challenging to understand functions through words. In addition, it may be cumbersome if we use [ordered pairs](/tree-posts/what-are-relations) or [mapping](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions). \nTo illustrate, let's consider an algebraic equation with independent variable \\\\(x\\\\) and dependent variable \\\\(y\\\\): \\\\(y=4x+5\\\\). Let's express this in terms of a function using three notations. Despite different forms, they all mean the same. \n## Notation 1: \\\\(f(x) = y\\\\)\nThis notation is the most common one out there. Using our example, the notation would be: \n\\\\(f(x)=4x+5\\\\)\nWe read this \\\\(f(x)\\\\) as “function of x _(or f of x)_ is four x plus five (the expression)\" \n-   The value \\\\(x\\\\) is your input value,\n-   \\\\(f\\\\) is the function which is \\\\(4x+5\\\\),\n-   \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is the output,\nUsually, we equate \\\\(f(x)\\\\), the output value in a function, with \\\\(y\\\\), the dependent variable in an equation; Because of this, we often interchange \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Similarly, we can also say that \\\\(x\\\\), the input value in a function, is the same as \\\\(x\\\\), the independent variable in an equation.\n## Notation 2: \\\\(f(x) = { (x,y) | y=... }\\\\)\nSometimes, we'll see notations similar to this one. Using our example, the naming would be:\n\\\\(f(x)={(x,y|y=4x+5)}\\\\)\nWe read this as: \"f of x is the set of ordered pairs (x,y) such that y=…\".\nTo understand this notation, we must view the \"y=...\" as an equation or a formula. Not a function by itself! (there's a difference between them). Furthermore, let's look at it part by part: \n-   \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is the output value, \n-   \\\\((x,y)\\\\) is an ordered pair, \n-   The vertical bar means \"such that\"\n-   \\\\(y=…\\\\) represents the equation\nHere, the ordered pair indicates that whatever equation is after the vertical bar, we have to view it as a function.\n## Notation 3: \\\\(f: X\\rightarrow{Y}\\\\)\nAnother notation we might encounter is by their sets; Looking into it, capital letters \\\\(X\\\\) and \\\\(Y\\\\) here are groups and not individual entries. Additionally, the arrow sign means \"mapped to.\"\nThis notation means the following: (1) the function is an ordered pair between the elements of sets \\\\(X\\\\) and \\\\(Y\\\\), or (2) the elements of \\\\(X\\\\) are mapped to the elements of \\\\(Y\\\\).\n## Can I Only Use \\\\(f\\\\)?\nWe can use other letters (or even name them using words) to name functions (not just \\\\(f\\\\)). It's up to one's preference on how to call it. \nLet's apply what we have learned to the radius-area (\\\\(r\\\\), \\\\(A\\\\)) relation, \\\\(A=\\pi{r^2}\\\\). The three possible notations are:\n-   \\\\(A(r)=\\pi{r^2}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(A(r)={(r,A|A=\\pi{r^2})}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(f:r\\rightarrow{A}\\\\)\nWe use \\\\(r\\\\) and \\\\(A\\\\) instead of \\\\(x\\\\) or \\\\(y\\\\) for us to remember what variables we are referring to easily. \nThere are a lot of other ways on how to name functions. Unless otherwise stated, we'll stick with the most common notation: \\\\(f(x)=y\\\\).\n## Summary\n> There are many function notations - ways of naming them.\n> The goal of analytical notation is to simplify how we express it.\n> The three common notations are: (1) \\\\(f(x)=y\\\\), (2) \\\\(f(x)={(x,y|y=...)}\\\\), and (3) \\\\(f:X\\rightarrow{Y}\\\\)\n> We can use other letters (or even name them using words) to name functions\n",

      "Free Content": "Structural analysis is the act of studying the structure's behavior imposed with loads. It's a way to understand, get to know, and explore the building's skeleton. We answer questions such as: is it stable? How much load is it carrying? What stresses is it experiencing? How much did it deflect?\nIt serves as an initial phase before going to the design stage - finding the suitable material, size, and shape of the structure. Overall, it comes after [analyzing the loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads) that the structure will experience in the [complete design cycle](/tree-posts/how-to-design-structures).\n## What Should We Analyze?\n![Overview of complete analysis](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ca9da3160816acbce798_WTS-Structure_16-1.png)\nThere are four critical aspects of a complete analysis:\n### Stability Analysis\nStability is a structure's ability to remain as is when applied with various loads. Analyzing this helps us to verify whether we have arranged our support and members well.\n### Reaction Analysis\nReaction analysis deals with finding out how much load the supports carry.\nSupport loads serve as the basis for the foundation or connection design of structures - what footings shall we use? How many bolts should each connection be?\n### **Force and Stress Analysis**\nAll objects experience stress. Part of a complete analysis is to identify these under the imposed loads.\nKnowing how much stress a member experiences will enable the engineer to appropriately design the structure's size and shape to these results.\n### **Deflection Analysis**\nThis type of analysis studies the structure's movement. In some design problems, engineers would need to limit it to ensure it's usable. For instance, imagine walking on a supporting beam, but it's pretty shaky - it's not the comfiest experience and may defeat the beam's purpose.\nPerforming these various analyses will depend on a lot of factors - the [type of analysis](/tree-posts/what-are-the-different-analysis-types) and the approach we would take. For now, it's best to discuss the [fundamental concepts](/tree-posts/what-are-the-key-analysis-concepts) that make up every procedure.\n## Summary\n> Structural analysis is the act of studying the structure's behavior imposed with loads.\n> It serves as an initial phase before going to the design stage\n> There are at least four aspects of complete analysis: stability, reaction, internal force and stresses, and deflection.\n> Stability is a structure's ability to remain as is when applied with various loads.\n> Reaction analysis deals with finding out how much load the structure supports carry.\n> Force and stress analyses deal with finding the internal effects of structures under imposed loads.\n> Deflection analysis studies the structure's movement from its original position.\n",

      "Free Content": "We can analyze structures using [work-energy principles](/tree-posts/reviewing-work-and-energy-in-structural-analysis) in specific structural analysis applications. This post shows how we can apply it. We'll show how we can use the virtual work method to analyze determinate beams.\n## Key Idea: Virtual Work, Work-Energy Theorem, and Equilibrium\nThe heart of this method revolves around three concepts: virtual work, work-energy theorem, and static [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium). We have a dedicated [post](/tree-posts/reviewing-work-and-energy-in-structural-analysis) if you need a refresher on these topics.\n## General Outline\nThe following is a general outline of how to use the virtual work method in beam analysis:\n### Set Up the Virtual Deflection\nWe first identify the component we want to solve at a specific point: reaction, shear, or moment. Afterward, we let it do \"work\" on the beam and allow it to deflect.\nFor example, say we are to find one of the reactions of a simple beam loaded with a concentrated load \\\\(P\\\\) at the midpoint; we let the unknown reaction force \\\\(R\\_A\\\\) deflect the beam from its original state to a corresponding deflected shape like the figure shown.\n![Set-up the virtual deflection of the beam](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64551ee1b036d97eaf919681_WTS-Structure_23.04-1.png)\nHow did we arrive at this deflected shape? Consider the beam as a lever with its reactions as pivot points. When \\\\(R\\_A\\\\) acts on it, it pushes the beam upward and pivots at the other support.\nIf we would like to solve for the other components, such as shear and moment, we apply the same concept. Say we would like to find the shear at the midpoint. We first expose it (by cutting a plane section in the middle and splitting the beam into two) and let it do \"work\" on both parts. Like the example above, the reactions act as pivot points; hence, the left rotates downward about the left-side support while the right rotates upward about the right-side support.\nThe deflected shape serves as our set-up when using the virtual work method. One important thing to note is that this shape is fictional. All translations and rotations resulting from letting the components do \"work\" on the beam are imaginary.\nThe purpose of this is to provide the fictional \\\\(\\Delta\\\\) or \\\\(\\theta\\\\) we need later on and create relationships from them.\n",

Therefore, there must be no kinetic energy acting on the beam \\\\(\\Delta{K}=0\\\\). As a result, the work-energy theorem becomes:\nWork-Energy Theorem (Static Equilibrium): \\\\(W\\_{tot}=0\\\\)\nTo illustrate this outline, let's consider an [example](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-beams-using-virtual-work).\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> We can use virtual work and the work-energy theorem to solve a structure's reactions and internal forces.\n> We first identify the component we want to solve: reaction, shear, or moment.

All [members](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member) are assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material). \n![Complex truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cf938e9cf516fb6d89fd_WTS-Structure_21.08-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe truss has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A \\\\(32kN (7.2kips)\\\\) concentrated load.\n-   A \\\\(160kN (36.0kips)\\\\) concentrated load.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Trusses, Determinate Truss_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n![Setting up the references of the complex truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cf9a8e9cf5487c6d8abb_WTS-Structure_21.08-2.png)\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the bottom-left joint of the truss. Consequently, the x-axis will run along the length of the truss with the y-axis perpendicular to it at the origin.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of supports, joints, and loads:\n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m)\\\\) \\\\(A(0.0', 0.0')\\\\). Hinge support and truss joint.\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 4.0m)\\\\) \\\\(B(0.0', 13.1')\\\\). Truss joint and location of \\\\(32kN (7.2kips)\\\\) horizontal load to the right.\n-   \\\\(C(4.0m, 6.0m)\\\\) \\\\(C(13.1', 19.7')\\\\).

Truss joint.\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor 2D trusses, it is:\n\\\\(D=(m+r)-2j\\\\)\nFor this truss example, there are 11 members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(AD\\\\), \\\\(AG\\\\), \\\\(BG\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), \\\\(CF\\\\), \\\\(DE\\\\), \\\\(EG\\\\), \\\\(EF\\\\), \\\\(FG\\\\), 7 joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\), \\\\(F\\\\), \\\\(G\\\\), and 3 reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(R\\_F\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=11+3)-2(7)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be thoroughly analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-truss-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(R\\_F\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the truss is externally stable. \nIn terms of its internal stability, the truss arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Solving the reactions of the complex truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cfa2e14ea87312be9e07_WTS-Structure_21.08-3.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left, and \n-   \\\\(A\\_v\\\\) and \\\\(R\\_F\\\\) are acting upwards.\nThen, applying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\rightarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(32-A\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_h=32kN (7.19kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_F}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(32(4)-160(4)+A\\_v(4+4+4+4)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=32kN (7.19kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(32+R\\_F-160=0\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_F=128kN (28.78)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components of the structure are: \n\\\\(A\\_h=32kN (7.19kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=32kN (7.19kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_F=128kN (28.78)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._\nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn our example, the predominant forces the members will experience are [axial](/tree-posts/what-is-a-truss).\n##### Modeling Axial Behavior\nOur task now is to determine the force developed for each member.\nGenerally, we use two primary methods to solve the member forces:\n-   The [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) and,\n-   The [method of sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections). \nFor this truss example, there are no joints with a maximum of two unknowns; hence, we can't use the first method. Finding a cutting plane that would cut only three unknown bar forces is also impossible. It means we can't use the second method also.\nIn addition, there are no connection elements present in the structure that we can cut through, so it is not a compound truss; Such is the nature of complex trusses. Solving this structure's internal bar forces will require another approach.\n##### Method of Bar Conversions\nThe [method of bar conversions](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-bar-conversions) is a procedure in which we break down the complex truss into a simple truss and a proxy truss. These trusses are solvable using Methods of Joints and Sections. When we solve these trusses, we combine their effects to get the internal bar force of the whole complex truss. Learn more about this method in this separate post.\nThe following section shows the summarized results for each truss member. _You can view the complete solution at this_ _[link](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-bar-conversions)._\n##### Axial\n![Bar force summary of complex truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cfaeb03b842b43ec7d1a_WTS-Structure_21.08-4.png)\n**Table**\nUsually, we summarize the results in a tabular format:\n‍\nFor easy reference, it is best to [categorize](/tree-posts/what-are-the-parts-of-a-truss) each member - top chord, bottom chords, and web members.\n**Diagram**\nSometimes, we may have a visual aid of the bar forces acting per member using axial diagrams:\n‍\nThese diagrams are helpful if we deal with members with varying cross sections or material along its length, for example.\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as:\n-   [Virtual Work Method](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work)\n_The author will post the mathematical solution for this example soon._\n",

An exciting feature of this problem is that we have an internal pin connecting two frames. All members are assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material).\n![Pin-connected frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64562948bb983c1e9475dfca_WTS-Structure_25.06-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe frame has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A varying linear load from \\\\(30kN/m (2.06kip/ft)\\\\) to \\\\(0kN/m (0kip/ft)\\\\).\n-   A \\\\(90kN•m (66.38kip•ft)\\\\) clockwise moment.\n-   A \\\\(15kN (3.37kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure.

It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\n##### Global References\n![Global references of pin-connected frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6456294e8d115b54c9613e35_WTS-Structure_25.06-2.png)\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the bottom-left point of the frame. Consequently, the x-axis will run horizontally with the y-axis perpendicular to it.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), change in [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads), and differences in the frame's [cross-sectional properties](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section). Starting from \\\\(A\\\\) and going around the structure, we identify the following points of interest: \n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The hinge support and the start of the varying distributed load of \\\\(30kN/m (2.06kip/ft)\\\\) **→**.\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 6.0m), B(0.0ft, 19.69ft)\\\\).

The \\\\(15kN (3.37kip)\\\\) concentrated load acting to the left.\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n##### Local References\n![Local references of pin-connected frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64562955068f055cc7651975_WTS-Structure_25.06-3.png)\nWhen dealing with structures composed of elements with varying properties and internal forces along their length, we need to create a localized reference system for each. It is a common step, especially when dealing with structural frames.\nThe first step would be to break the frame into its members. \nThen, we analyze each member separately and assign a location of the local origin. Usually, we place it at the left-most part of the member when looking inside the frame. You can put it on the right-most side - there is no hard rule. What's important is consistency, and it must be understandable. The x-axis would go along the length of the member while the y-axis would run perpendicular to it. \nFinally, from the selected origin, we label each point of interest.\nLet's illustrate how we can create our local system for each member. In our frame example, we have three members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), and \\\\(CD\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(AB\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(A\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(B(6.0m, 0.0m), B(19.69ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(BC\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(B\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 0.0m), B(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(E(4.0m, 0.0m), E(13.12ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(C(6.0m, 0.0m), C(19.69ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(CD\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(C\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(C(0.0m, 0.0m), C(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(F(3.61m, 0.0m), F(11.84ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(D(7.22m, 0.0m), D(23.69ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor a 2D frame, it is:\n\\\\(D=(3m+r)-(3j+c)\\\\)\nFor this frame example, there are three members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), four joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), four reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(D\\_h\\\\), \\\\(D\\_v\\\\), and one internal connection at joint \\\\(C\\\\) \\\\(e\\_c = 1\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=(3(3)+4)-(3(4)+1)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-frame-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h, A\\_v, D\\_h, D\\_v\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the frame is externally stable. In terms of its internal stability, the frame arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Reaction analysis of pin-connected frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6456295d2beb50db7da72eac_WTS-Structure_25.06-4.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) and \\\\(D\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left,\n-   \\\\(A\\_v\\\\) is acting downward, and \n-   \\\\(D\\_v\\\\) is acting upward.\nApplying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_A}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\frac{1}{2}(30)(6)(\\frac{1}{3}\\times6)+90-15(3)-D\\_v(4+2+2+2)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_v=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(22.5-A\\_v=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\n##### Break Down the Frame\n![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645629788d115bfc91613ebf_WTS-Structure_25.06-5.png)\nAt this point, we have solved the vertical reactions of the hinge supports. All that is left is to solve for the horizontal components.\nTo solve these reactions, we need to \"disconnect\" the pin-connected frame at points of internal connections. In our example, it would be the hinge at point \\\\(C\\\\). \nAs a result, we will have the free-body diagrams (FBD) of each frame element - FBD ABC and FBD CD.\nFor each diagram, we have the joint \\\\(C\\\\). At this point, the hinge will provide two forces: \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_v\\\\), which are unknown.\nAt this hinge, it will provide an additional condition: the summation of moments at that point is zero. We can use this to help us solve the reactions.\nIn terms of its directions, \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) and \\\\(C\\_v\\\\) are also unknown. Normally, one assumes the direction. Said directions must be opposite for each FBD to comply with Newton's Third Law.\n-   In FBD ABC, \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) acts to the left while \\\\(C\\_v\\\\) acts upward.\n-   In FBD CD, \\\\(C\\_h\\\\) acts to the right while \\\\(C\\_v\\\\) acts downward.\nTo solve for the reactions, as well as the hinge, all we have to do is to apply the equilibrium principle to these individual FBDs. Let's demonstrate below:\n##### Free Body Diagram CD\nApplying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_C}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(15(3)-22.5(2+2)+D\\_h(6)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_h=7.5kN (1.69kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\rightarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(C\\_h-15-7.5=0\\\\)\n\\\\(C\\_h=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(22.5-C\\_v=0\\\\)\n\\\\(C\\_v=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components and the hinge forces are:\n\\\\(D\\_h=7.5kN (1.69kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(C\\_h=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(C\\_v=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n##### Free Body Diagram ABC\nApplying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(22.5+A\\_h-\\frac{1}{2}(30)(6)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_h=67.5kN (15.17kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction component is:\n\\\\(A\\_h=67.5kN (15.17kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\nAt this point, we have now solved the reaction components. \n\\\\(A\\_h=67.5kN (15.17kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_h=7.5kN (1.69kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(D\\_v=22.5kN (5.06kip)\\\\)\nWe can verify the results by applying the equilibrium principle to the whole structure.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._\nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn 2D frames, we limit to axial, shear, and moment only.\n##### Modeling Axial, Shear, and Moment Behavior\nWe can use axial, shear, and moment equations and graphs to describe the internal behavior of each frame member.\nCreating these equations and diagrams deserves a separate section. Learn more about how to construct these using these individual posts:\n-   [Axial Forces](/tree-posts/modeling-axial-force)\n-   [Shear and Moment Equations and Diagrams](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment)\n##### Local System\nThe following section shows each frame member's axial, shear, and moment behavior in the local system. _You can view the complete solution in this_ _[link](/tree-posts/how-to-perform-force-analysis-for-pin-connected-frames)._\n##### Member AB\n##### Member BC\n##### Member CD\n##### Global System\nThe following section shows all frame members' combined axial, shear, and moment diagrams.\n![Combined axial, shear, and moment diagrams of pin-connected frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645912e5fb7d73fa8e178cdd_WTS-Structure_PinConnectedFrame_001.png)\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as the following:\n-   [Area Moment Method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-area-moment-method)\n-   [Virtual Work Method](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work)\n_The author will post the mathematical solution for this example soon. In the meantime, we can describe its deflection_ _[qualitatively](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflections-qualitatively)._\n-   When the member experiences a positive moment, the member concaves upward, locally speaking\n-   When the member experiences a negative moment, the member concaves downward, locally speaking\n-   The hinge support restricts the frame's translation at that point but is free to rotate.\n-   The joints turned but maintained their rigidity.\n",

The object consists of a uniform cross-section throughout its whole length. We generated the solid by revolving the area along its axis of rotation. \nWe must divide the solid into multiple parts to estimate the total volume. We can imagine these parts as a series of similar plane sections stacked on each other to make up the 3D object.\nFor a solid of revolution, we can divide it into either discs or shells. For this post, we will use the latter.\nFrom this, we begin the process of approximating:\n1.  First, divide the 3D object into multiple regular shells.\n2.  Then, we solve each shell's volume \\\\(V\\\\). It is equal to \\\\(2 \\pi R h w\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is the radius (to the center portion of the shell), \\\\(h\\\\) is the height, and \\\\(w\\\\) is the thickness of the shell. We'll present the derivation in the following section.\n3.  Finally, we add all individual \\\\(V\\\\) to get the total approximate volume.\nSince this is an approximation, how can we have a more accurate answer?

All [members](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member) are assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material).\n![Special compound truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cecbcbc3b72fcf62cc50_WTS-Structure_21.07-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe truss has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A \\\\(106.8kN (24kips)\\\\) concentrated load.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n",
      "Paid Content": "## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Trusses, Determinate Truss_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n![Setting-up the reference of the compound truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ced4b03b8408aaec6c1f_WTS-Structure_21.07-2.png)\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the bottom-left joint of the truss. Consequently, the x-axis will run along the length of the truss with the y-axis perpendicular to it at the origin.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), [joints](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections), and [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads):\n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m)\\\\) \\\\(A(0.0', 0.0')\\\\). Hinge support and truss joint.\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 1.83m)\\\\) \\\\(B(0.0', 6.0')\\\\). Truss joint.\n-   \\\\(C(3.66m, 4.57m)\\\\) \\\\(C(12.0', 15.0')\\\\). Truss joint.\n-   \\\\(D(7.32m, 4.57m)\\\\) \\\\(D(24.0', 15.0')\\\\). Truss joint and location of \\\\(106.8kN (24kips)\\\\) horizontal load to the right.\n-   \\\\(E(10.98m, 1.8m)\\\\) \\\\(E(36.0', 6.0')\\\\). Truss joint.\n-   \\\\(F(10.98m, 0.0m)\\\\) \\\\(F(36.0', 0.0')\\\\). Roller support and truss joint.\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor 2D trusses, it is:\n\\\\(D=(m+r)-2j\\\\)\nFor this truss example, there are 9 members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), \\\\(DE\\\\), \\\\(EF\\\\), \\\\(AD\\\\), \\\\(AE\\\\), \\\\(BF\\\\), \\\\(CF\\\\), 6 joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\), \\\\(F\\\\), and 3 reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(R\\_F\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=(9+3)-2(6)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be thoroughly analyzed using only the equilibrium equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-beam-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(R\\_F\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the truss is externally stable. \nIn terms of its internal stability, the truss arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Solving for the reactions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cede1ddcb09fb1e5381c_WTS-Structure_21.07-3.png)\n‍_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left, and \n-   \\\\(A\\_v\\\\) acting downward, and\n-   \\\\(R\\_F\\\\) acting upward.\nThen, applying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\rightarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(106.8-A\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_h=106.8kN (24kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_F}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(106.8(2.74+1.83)-A\\_v(3.66+3.66+3.66)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=44.48kN (10kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_F-44.48=0\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_F=44.48kN (10kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components of the structure are: \n\\\\(A\\_h=106.8kN (24kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=44.48kN (10kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_F=44.48kN (10kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._\nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn our example, the predominant forces the members will experience are [axial](/tree-posts/what-is-a-truss).\n##### Modeling Axial Behavior\nOur task now is to determine the force developed for each member.\nRecall that we can use two methods to solve the member forces:\n-   The [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) and,\n-   The [method of sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections). \nNormally we would proceed to either of the two methods, as we have demonstrated for a simple truss. However, if we look at our example, we'll discover that each joint has three unknowns making it impossible to use the method of joints from the very start. Likewise, it is hard to identify three truss members that we can cut to use the method of sections. \nTo analyze such compound trusses, we first have to find the simple trusses that make up the compound truss and investigate the elements of connection.\n##### Connection Elements\n![Identifying the elements of connection and simple trusses](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ceeae14ea85bfbbe9510_WTS-Structure_21.07-4.png)\nRecall that a [compound truss](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-trusses) is simply a combination of two or more simple trusses connected by _elements of connection_. These connections can either be a link or a hinge.\nAgain, identify all simple trusses first. There are two simple trusses: \\\\(ADE\\\\) and \\\\(BCF\\\\). It leaves us with three elements of connection: members \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), and \\\\(EF\\\\).\n###### Stability of Connection Elements\nIn identifying the connection elements, we must also analyze if the connection between simple trusses is stable. The connection elements must also obey the basic external stability rules:\n1.  All component forces must not be collinear, parallel, or concurrent.\n2.  There must be at least 3 component connections.\nIn our truss example, our links do not violate these rules; hence, it is stable. This step ensures that we keep key concepts intact when solving our truss.\n###### Use the Method of Sections for Connection Elements\n![Placing a section along connection elements](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cefa8e9cf575bc6d7ffc_WTS-Structure_21.07-5.png)\nAfter identifying the elements of connection and analyzing if it is stable, we use the [method of sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections) to solve for the bar forces developed in these connection elements. Place the cutting plane so that at least we reveal one of these internal forces.\nContinue with the solution and analyze one part of the truss and solve for the bar forces:\n\\\\(\\sum{M}\\_G=0]\\circlearrowleft\\_+\\\\)\n\\\\(106.8(2.74+1.83)+F\\_{EF}(3.66+3.66+3.66)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{EF}=-44.45kN (C)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M}\\_H=0]\\circlearrowleft\\_+\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AB}(3.66+3.66+3.66)-44.45(3.66+3.66+3.66)+106.8(2.74+1.83)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{AB}=0kN\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(106.8-106.8-F\\_{DC}=0\\\\)\n\\\\(F\\_{DC}=0kN\\\\)\nOnce you have solved for the internal force on one connection element, it becomes possible to solve for the bar forces of the entire compound truss structure. You can use the method of [joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) or sections to continue with the solution.\nThe following section shows the summarized results for each truss member._The author will post a complete solution soon._\n##### Axial\n![Bar force summary of special compound truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cf224fe56542d97816cd_WTS-Structure_21.07-6.png)\n**Table**\nUsually, we summarize the results in a tabular format:\n‍\nFor easy reference, it is best to [categorize](/tree-posts/what-are-the-parts-of-a-truss) each member - top chord, bottom chords, and web members.\n**Diagram**\nSometimes, we may have a visual aid of the bar forces acting per member using axial diagrams:\n‍\nThese diagrams are helpful if we deal with members with varying cross sections or material along its length, for example.\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as:\n-   [Virtual Work Method](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work)\n_The author will post the mathematical solution for this example soon._\n",

Let's now take a closer look at these parts and discuss specific terminologies.\nThere may be more specific terms that you may encounter, especially in construction engineering, such as 'king post' or 'strut' - we will NOT delve into those. We're interested in terminologies related to structural analysis.\n![Parts of a structural truss](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453b2963e05a63e6576af84_WTS-Structure_3.12-1.png)\n## Members\nThe [members](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member) of the truss are its long slender components. There are two essential types:\n### Chords\nThe chords are the _'perimeter members'_ of the truss. Essentially, these members define the shape of the truss.\nIn our example, we have members \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BD\\\\), and \\\\(DE\\\\) as _top chords_ while members \\\\(AC\\\\) and \\\\(CE\\\\) are _bottom chords_. Whether the member is a top or bottom chord will depend on the purpose of the truss. For example,\n-   For a roof truss, members that carry the roof and purlins directly are the top chords. Any chord that does not withstand these loads is the bottom chord.\n-   For a bridge truss, members supporting the road are the bottom chords, while the other chords are the top chords.\n### Webs\nAnything that is not a chord is a web member. Some references refer to it as the diagonals because the diagonal truss members are usually the webs. In our example, the web members are \\\\(BC\\\\) and \\\\(CD\\\\)\nWebs usually maintain the shape defined by the chord members. Generally, these are responsible for maintaining the rigidity of the truss.\n## Connections\nThe [connections](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections) at the end of the truss members are commonly called _joints_. Going back to our example, we have 5 joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\).\nThe joints are locations where the [external load](/tree-posts/structural-loads) is applied. Later on, we'll discuss [basic analysis assumptions](/tree-posts/analyzing-the-structural-truss) related to these connections.\n## Summary\n> The members of the truss are its long slender components.\n> The chords are the _'perimeter members'_ of the truss.

This post explains more about this event:\n## Modeling Logistics\n![The logistic differential equation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e35ced18c30a32410f084b_WTS-1-Mathematics_LogisticDifferentialEquation-1.png)\nLet's recall that for some phenomena, the rate of change is directly proportional to its quantity, just like we did with growth and decay; However, this is only sometimes the case. To illustrate, let's look at population growth. We can model it exponentially as \\\\(y=Ce^{kt}\\\\), but this assumes that the population will grow infinitely.\nAs time passes, population growth decreases because of a specific limitation \\\\(L\\\\). It happens due to a lot of factors. In our example, the growth slowed down probably because the place has limited resources to offer its people; hence, people leave the area. As a consequence, it regulates growth.\nIt may be best to model these events using the logistic differential equation. Pierre François Verhulst, a Belgian Mathematician, first created this equation. It states that the rate of change is directly proportional to the difference between quantity \\\\(y\\\\) and a limiting term \\\\(\\frac{y^2}{L}\\\\):\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d y}{d t} \\propto \\left(y-\\frac{y^2}{L}\\right)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d y}{d t} \\propto y\\left(1-\\frac{y}{L}\\right)\\\\)\n-   \\\\(\\frac{d y}{d t}=k y\\left(1-\\frac{y}{L}\\right)\\\\)\nThe model grows at a \\\\(k\\\\) growth rate as time \\\\(t\\\\) goes by.

      "Paid Content": "## Example\nWe can find this function in population growth, epidemiology studies, ecology, artificial learning, and more. For this example, let's consider a situation about a virus epidemic:\nThe city government formally announced a virus epidemic. According to medical data, it took five days for the virus to infect from 3 to 376 people. Assuming the officials have taken no measures, how many infected residents are there after 15 days in a city with a population of 107,524?\n### Identify\nIn this problem, we must find the number of infected residents after 15 days. First, we identify some variables:\n-   \\\\(y\\\\) is the number of people infected\n-   \\\\(t\\\\) is time in days\nSince we are talking about the virus here, the maximum number of people it can infect is 107,524 (assuming a fixed population); hence \\\\(L=107,524\\\\)\nThe problem also states some conditions, which we can outline below:\n-   Initial Condition: There were three people infected on day 0.\n-   Secondary Condition: there were 376 people infected after five days.\n### Find the Model\nWe use the logistic function general solution to model the event as derived earlier:\n\\\\(y=\\frac{L}{1+C e^{-k t}}\\\\)\nAfter identifying the model, we need to find the [particular solution](/tree-posts/what-is-a-differential-equation-solution) by finding constants \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) using the conditions in the problem.\nFor \\\\(C\\\\), let's use the first condition to solve it:\n-   \\\\(3=\\frac{107,524}{1+C e^{-k \\cdot 0}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(C=35,840.33\\\\)\nFor \\\\(k\\\\), we use the secondary condition:\n-   \\\\(376=\\frac{107,524}{1+35,840.33 e^{-k \\cdot 5}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(k=0.96689\\\\)\nNow that we know these constants, we can now form the model\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{107,524}{1+35,840.33 e^{-0.96689 t}}\\\\)\nThis expression is the function we use to determine the number of people sick in the city. We can see a graphical view of the function below. This graph shows that the virus will start approaching the limit after quite some time because there is no more person to infect.\n### Evaluate\nWe need to find the number of infected people after 15 days. Let's substitute \\\\(t=15\\\\) to the equation to determine the value:\n-   \\\\(y=\\frac{107,524}{1+35,840.33 e^{-0.96689 \\cdot 15}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(y=105,621.19\\\\)\nAfter 15 days since day zero, the number of infected people will be 105,621. Almost all of the city is already sick by that time. Investigating this model can let city officials and health experts know what they are dealing with. It gives them a sense of their available time to create measures.\n## Summary\n> Logistic differential equation deals with modeling growth or decay events with a limit \\\\(L\\\\)\n> It states that the rate of change is directly proportional to the difference between quantity \\\\(y\\\\) and a limiting term \\\\(\\frac{y^2}{L}\\\\): \\\\(\\frac{d y}{d t}=k y\\left(1-\\frac{y}{L}\\right)\\\\) The model grows at a \\\\(k\\\\) growth rate as time \\\\(t\\\\) goes by.

The value inside the parenthesis () is the member's cross-sectional area \\\\(A\\\\) in square centimeters. \n![Truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a5bbae5e39800e1f90ea_WTS-Structure_31.0005-1.png)\nSay that we are interested in finding the resultant translation \\\\(\\Delta\\_E\\\\) of point E, as well as the rotation of member \\\\(CE\\\\) \\\\(\\theta\\_{CE}\\\\). The resultant deflection \\\\(\\Delta\\_E\\\\) implies to us that we need to find the horizontal and vertical translation \\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_h}\\\\) and \\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}\\\\) of \\\\(E\\\\)\nFor this problem, we'll assume that all members are made of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material) so that the modulus of elasticity \\\\(E\\\\) is constant.\n## Main Solution\n",
      "Paid Content": "### Set-Up Virtual Structures\nThe first step is to represent each deflection component with a unit load and apply it to a corresponding virtual structure. We would also need to assume the direction of each element:\n-   Horizontal translation at \\\\(E\\\\) is to the right; hence, the applied unit load also acts to the right.\n-   Vertical translation at \\\\(E\\\\) is downward; hence, the applied unit vertical load also acts downward.\nTo find the rotation of member \\\\(CE\\\\), we represent it with two equal parallel forces applied perpendicularly at both ends of member \\\\(CE\\\\); so that the effect resembles a unit couple. We'll assume this couple acts clockwise to represent a clockwise rotation.\n![Set-up virtual structures](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a5c96ea1db093850f2ce_WTS-Structure_31.0005-2.png)\n### Formulate S, u, A, and E Equations.\nAfter creating the virtual structures, it's time to find \\\\(S\\\\), \\\\(u\\\\), \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(A\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\) of each member for both the virtual and superimposed structures. As seen below, creating a matrix that summarizes all these variables is best for this approach.\nWe first identify \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(A\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\) for each truss member. If these variables [vary](/tree-posts/what-are-mathematical-functions) along the member's length, we must express it in terms of \\\\(x\\\\) (member's local axis). Since our example deals with constant [axial rigidity](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-rigidity) \\\\(AE\\\\), we do not have to worry about those instances.\nNext, we solve for the bar forces \\\\(S\\\\) of the superimposed structure, as well as the bar forces of the virtual equivalent \\\\(u\\_h\\\\), \\\\(u\\_v\\\\), and \\\\(u\\_{\\alpha\\_{CE}}\\\\). We can do this exactly using the [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints), the [method of sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections), or a combination of both, depending on the truss type. \n![Bar forces S for real structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a5ef3f03ef0481b597fd_WTS-Structure_31.0005-3.png)\n![Bar forces uv for virtual structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a5f803d5822d3aeeace1_WTS-Structure_31.0005-4.png)\n![Bar forces uh for virtual structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a5ffe0a03c308f50eec3_WTS-Structure_31.0005-5.png)\n![Bar forces um for virtual structure](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6457a61002e5cf80ff656b94_WTS-Structure_31.0005-6.png)\nWe summarise our results for all bar forces \\\\(S\\\\), \\\\(u\\_h\\\\), \\\\(u\\_v\\\\), and \\\\(u\\_{\\alpha\\_{CE}}\\\\) in the table. Positive bar forces are in tension, while negative-sensed bar forces are in compression.\n### Apply Virtual Work Equations\nThe final step of the process is to apply the [virtual work equations](/tree-posts/deriving-virtual-work-due-to-axial-strains):\n\\\\(1 \\times \\Delta\\_{E\\_h}=\\sum\\_{i=0}^n \\frac{S\\_i u\\_{E\\_{h\\_i}} L\\_i}{A\\_i E\\_i}\\\\)\n\\\\(1 \\times \\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=\\sum\\_{i=0}^n \\frac{S\\_i u\\_{E\\_{v\\_i}} L\\_i}{A\\_i E\\_i}\\\\)\n\\\\(1 \\times \\theta\\_{C E}=\\sum\\_{i=0}^n \\frac{S\\_i u\\_{C E\\_{\\alpha\\_i}} L\\_i}{A\\_i E\\_i}\\\\)\nWe can use the table above to add the corresponding values for each column to determine the deflection. For horizontal and vertical translation:\n\\\\(1 \\times \\Delta\\_{E\\_h}=0+0-\\frac{45}{E}-\\frac{22.5}{E}+0+0\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_h}=-\\frac{67.5}{E}\\\\)\n\\\\(1 \\times \\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=\\frac{16.875}{E}+\\frac{62.5}{E}+\\frac{67.5}{E}+\\frac{16.875}{E}+\\frac{156.25}{E}+\\frac{80}{E}\\\\)\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_{E\\_v}=\\frac{400}{E}\\\\)\nThe negative sign of the horizontal translation means that the movement of joint \\\\(E\\\\) is to the left instead of the right. On the other hand, the positive sign of vertical translation means that the movement is indeed downward. With these two translation components, we can finally solve for the resultant deflection:\n\\\\(\\Delta\\_E=\\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{67.5}{E}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{400}{E}\\right)^2}=\\frac{405.66}{E}\\\\)\nThe only remaining component we need to answer is the rotation of member \\\\(CE\\\\). By adding all the values in the table, we have:\n\\\\(1 \\times \\theta\\_{C E}=\\frac{0.5625}{E}+\\frac{0.75}{E}+\\frac{1.125}{E}+\\frac{0.5625}{E}+0+0\\\\)\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{C E}=\\frac{3}{E}\\\\)\nThe positive direction confirms our assumption that member \\\\(CE\\\\) rotated clockwise from its original position.\n",

The [resistance force](/tree-posts/what-is-fluid-resistance) has gained enough magnitude to equate to [gravitational pull](/tree-posts/what-is-gravitational-force).

It is still falling, but it will never get faster.\nThis speed the falling object reaches when \\\\(F\\_g\\\\) and \\\\(F\\_f\\\\) are equal is what we call the terminal velocity.\nMathematically speaking, we can express it by taking the limit of the v-t function to infinity:\n\\\\(\\lim \\_{t \\rightarrow+\\infty} v(t)=\\lim \\_{t \\rightarrow+\\infty}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{m g}{k}} \\tanh \\left(\\operatorname{arctanh}\\left(v\\_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m g}}\\right)-t \\sqrt{\\frac{k g}{m}}\\right)\\right)=-\\sqrt{\\frac{m g}{k}}\\\\)\n\\\\(v\\_t=-\\sqrt{\\frac{mg}{k}}\\\\)\n-   \\\\(v\\_t\\\\) is the terminal velocity\n-   \\\\(m\\\\) is the object's mass\n-   \\\\(g\\\\) is the acceleration due to gravity\n-   \\\\(k\\\\) is the proportionality constant (drag)\n## Illustration\nTo illustrate this phenomenon, below is an example plot of the motion functions with the following parameters:\n-   The falling object has a mass of 65 kg \\\\(m\\\\)\n-   It has an initial velocity of \\\\(v\\_0=0\\\\) \n-   It came from a height of 800m, initial position \\\\(s\\_0\\\\)\n-   Gravitational acceleration is 9.81 \\\\(\\frac{m}{s^2}\\\\)\n-   Variable \\\\(k\\\\) is equal to 0.035\nLet's say that this object falls forever. There would be a point where the velocity would remain constant at around 135 m/s (see v-t graph) around 90 seconds after dropping it. At this point, we have reached the terminal velocity.\nInterestingly, in our acceleration-time graph, acceleration will eventually become zero around the same time.

If the shear is upward, the rotation is counterclockwise.\n-   If the moment is counterclockwise, then the deflections are downward. If the moment is clockwise, then the deflection is upward.\nWhen analyzing the right section:\n-   If the shear is upward, the rotation is clockwise. If the shear is downward, the rotation is counterclockwise.\n-   If the moment is clockwise, then the deflections are downward. If the moment is counterclockwise, then the deflection is upward.\n## ‍Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> Knowing the deflection's directions will depend on the beam analysis convention.\nFor concaved upward convention, when analyzing the left section:\n> If the shear is downward, the rotation is clockwise. If the shear is upward, the rotation is counterclockwise.\n> If the moment is counterclockwise, then the deflections are downward. If the moment is clockwise, then the deflection is upward.\nFor concaved upward convention, when analyzing the right section:\n> If the shear is upward, the rotation is clockwise.

Unlike [virtual work](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work) involving a fictional load, we'll use actual forces and displacements to find translations and rotations.\nGenerally, there are two approaches: (1) general real work and (2) [Castigliano's second theorem](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-the-partial-derivative-method).\n## Setting Up the General Real Work Equation\nSay we have a simple [beam](/tree-posts/what-is-a-beam) \\\\(AB\\\\) loaded with a point load \\\\(F\\\\) at point \\\\(C\\\\).

      "Free Content": "The method of joints for truss analysis is one of the two essential solutions to solve for the internal forces of any [truss](/tree-posts/what-is-a-truss) structure (the other being the [method of sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections)).\n## Key Idea: Disassemble the Truss\n![Break the truss into its components](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ccb6637d396281da3b03_WTS-Structure_21.03-1.png)\nLet's recall that the truss is simply an assemblage of members. The fundamental principle for this method is to break down this structure into its components and analyze the free body diagrams (FBD) for each joint and member. We can then solve for the member force using key analysis concepts.\n## General Outline\nThe following is a general outline of how to use the method of joints (for [plane structures](/tree-posts/plane-and-spatial-structures)):\n### Analyze Joint Connection Forces with Two Unknowns First\n![Analyze joint with a maximum of two unknowns first](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cccda316081ef5bd0e01_WTS-Structure_21.03-2.png)\nAfter breaking the truss into its components, we first start analyzing the free-body diagram of a joint with a maximum of two unknown forces (for 2D truss) or three unknown forces (for 3D truss). It doesn't matter which joint as long as we follow this requirement. \nThis number corresponds to the number of [equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium) equations we can use for each joint. The key idea here is to use these equations to solve for the forces acting on the joint. We cannot start this method with a connection with unknowns greater than the possible number of equilibrium equations.\n### Analyze Adjacent Members and Joints\n![Analyze adjacent components after](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432ccd592ccec4a132e818c_WTS-Structure_21.03-3.png)\nAfter analyzing one joint, we can interpret the adjacent free-body diagrams and determine the internal bar force for each member.\nUsing Newton's Third Law, the force on the joint must exert something similar of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the connecting end of the adjacent member. For the whole member to be in equilibrium, it must have a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction at the other end of the member. This load is the internal bar force of the truss member.\nPart of the analysis is also to know whether the axial force is either [tension or compression](/tree-posts/what-is-internal-force). \n-   If the two opposing forces cause the member to shorten, the internal bar force in the member is a compressive axial force. \n-   If these two end forces cause the member to elongate, then the axial force is tension.\nAfter analyzing the member, we repeat the process of transferring the force from the member to the next adjacent joint and solve again for these unknowns as we did in the first step.\n### Repeat Analysis\nAt this point, you may already see a general pattern for the method of joints. You're moving your computed bar forces from one joint to member to the next joint. It is a repetition of steps 1 and 2 until we finally solve all internal bar force members:\n## Tips\n-   When we don't consider the weight of the members or external forces applied to it (plus, the members of the truss are all straight lines), we don't usually anymore analyze the free body diagram of the member itself. Most references only examine the joints' FBD and interpret the internal bar force from the joint connection force. As an observation, if the joint connection force is acting away from the joint, the bar force is in tension, while if it is working towards it, it is a compressive force.\n-   Some joints will require you to simultaneously solve two unknowns which is possible since you have two equilibrium equations for plane trusses. For space trusses, you can simultaneously solve three.\n-   A joint may have more than two unknowns. In these instances, you can proceed to other joints instead and work your way back toward that joint with more than two unknowns. In this way, you're eliminating the number of unknowns for that specific joint.\n-   Nearing the end of your analysis, you'll realize that you have solved every internal bar force without analyzing one last joint. It is always a good idea to double-check your computations by examining this joint and ensuring that all components' sum equals zero; otherwise, your solution might need to be corrected.\n## Summarise Your Results\nAfter analysis, it is always a good idea to summarise your results using a table.\n## Application\n-   Let's illustrate how to use the method of joints using this [truss example](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-joints).\n## Summary\nLet's summarize:\n> The method of joints for truss analysis is one of the two essential solutions to solve for the internal forces of any truss structure (the other being the method of sections).\n> The fundamental principle for this method is to break down this structure into its components and analyze the free body diagrams (FBD) for each joint and member.\n> We analyze a joint with two unknowns first, then analyze adjacent components. We continually repeat this pattern until we have thoroughly examined all bar forces.\n",

All members are assumed to have a uniform [section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material).\n![Rigid gable frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6456277b2beb503950a70756_WTS-Structure_25.04-1.png)\n## Structural Load\nThe frame has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A \\\\(20kN (4.50kip)\\\\) concentrated load\n-   A uniform load of \\\\(10kN/m (0.69kip/ft)\\\\) - acts on a 4m (13.12ft) horizontal projection\n-   A \\\\(60kN (13.49kip)\\\\) concentrated load\n-   A \\\\(5kN (1.12kip)\\\\) concentrated load\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Frame, Determinate Frame_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\n##### Global References\n![Global references of rigid gable frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64562788cb110d248ea97dc8_WTS-Structure_25.04-2.png)\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the bottom-left point of the frame. Consequently, the x-axis will run horizontally with the y-axis perpendicular to it.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), change in [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads), and differences in the frame's [cross-sectional properties](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section). Starting from \\\\(A\\\\) and going around the structure, we identify the following points of interest: \n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). The hinge support.\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 5.0m), B(0.0ft, 16.40ft)\\\\).

The \\\\(60kN (13.49kip)\\\\) vertical downward concentrated load.\n-   \\\\(G(10.0m, 2.5m), G(32.81ft, 8.20ft)\\\\).

The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n##### Local References\n![Local references of rigid gable frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6456279209c5e134860c3893_WTS-Structure_25.04-3.png)\nWhen dealing with structures composed of elements with varying properties and internal forces along their length, we need to create a localized reference system for each. It is a common step, especially when dealing with structural frames.\nThe first step would be to break the frame into its members. \nThen, we analyze each member separately and assign a location of the local origin. Usually, we place it at the left-most part of the member when looking inside the frame. You can put it on the right-most side - there is no hard rule. What's important is consistency, and it must be understandable. The x-axis would go along the length of the member while the y-axis would run perpendicular to it. \nFinally, from the selected origin, we label each point of interest.\nLet's illustrate how we can create our local system for each member. In our frame example, we have four members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), and \\\\(DE\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(AB\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(A\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m), A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(B(5.0m, 0.0m), B(16.40ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(BC\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(B\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(B(0.0m, 0.0m), B(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(C(5.0m, 0.0m), C(16.40ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(CD\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(C\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(C(0.0m, 0.0m), C(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(F(2.236m, 0.0m), F(7.34ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(D(6.71m, 0.0m), D(22.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\nIn member \\\\(DE\\\\), let the origin be joint \\\\(D\\\\), the local coordinates of the member are:\n-   \\\\(D(0.0m, 0.0m), D(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(G(2.5m, 0.0m), G(8.20ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n-   \\\\(E(5.0m, 0.0m), E(16.40ft, 0.0ft)\\\\).\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor a 2D frame, it is:\n\\\\(D=(3m+r)-(3j+c)\\\\)\nFor this frame example, there are four members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), \\\\(DE\\\\), five joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\) and three reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(R\\_E\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=(3(4)+3)-(3(5)+0)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-frame-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h, A\\_v, R\\_E\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the frame is externally stable. In terms of its internal stability, the frame arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Reaction analysis of rigid gable frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645627a08d115b5f22612440_WTS-Structure_25.04-4.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left, and \n-   \\\\(A\\_v\\\\) and \\\\(R\\_E\\\\) are acting upwards.\nThen, applying the equilibrium equations (to the global system):\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\leftarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(20-5-A\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_h=15kN (3.37kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_A}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(20(5)+10(4)(\\frac{1}{2}\\times4)+60(4+2)-5(2.5)-R\\_E(4+6)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_E=52.75kN (11.86kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v+52.75-60-10(4)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=47.25kN (10.62kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components of the structure are: \n\\\\(A\\_h=15kN (3.37kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=47.25kN (10.62kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_E=52.75kN (11.86kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._\nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn 2D frames, we limit to axial, shear, and moment only.\n##### Modeling Axial, Shear, and Moment Behavior\nWe can use axial, shear, and moment equations and graphs to describe the internal behavior of each frame member.\nCreating these equations and diagrams deserves a separate section. Learn more about how to construct these using these individual posts:\n-   [Axial Forces](/tree-posts/modeling-axial-force)\n-   [Shear and Moment Equations and Diagrams](/tree-posts/modeling-shear-and-moment)\n##### Local System\nThe following section shows each frame member's axial, shear, and moment behavior in the local system. _You can view the complete solution in this_ _[link](/tree-posts/how-to-perform-force-analysis-for-gable-frames)._\n##### Member AB\n##### Member BC\n##### Member CD\n##### Member DE\n##### Global System\nThe following section shows all frame members' combined axial, shear, and moment diagrams.\n![Combined axial, shear, and moment diagrams of rigid gable frame example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/645912bb51ed320aece8f0aa_WTS-Structure_GableFrame_001.png)\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as the following:\n-   [Area Moment Method](/tree-posts/what-is-the-area-moment-method)\n-   [Virtual Work Method](/tree-posts/how-to-solve-deflections-using-virtual-work)\n_The author will post the mathematical solution for this example soon. In the meantime, we can describe its deflection_ _[qualitatively](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflections-qualitatively)._\n-   When the member experiences a positive moment, the member concaves upward, locally speaking\n-   When the member experiences a negative moment, the member concaves downward, locally speaking\n-   The hinge support restricts the frame's translation at that point but is free to rotate.\n-   The roller support restricts vertical translation at that point but is free to move horizontally or rotate.\n-   The joints turned but maintained their rigidity.\n",

In today's time, it is something that is still growing.\nBack in the day, engineers analyzed structures by hand. They would gather papers, calculators, and spreadsheets and solve them. They use principles developed from Mechanics to examine buildings. This style was said to be the [classical approach](/tree-posts/analysis-methods-of-the-classical-approach).\nAs society progressed and structures became larger and larger, there was a need to have a faster and more accurate way of analyzing buildings to meet the demand; Eventually, with the rise of modern computers, a new approach was made called the matrix approach.\nStructures didn't just grow larger over time - they also grew complex. Engineers adopted the Finite Element Method (FEM) approach to cope with this demand.\nWe'll learn more about each approach in a separate [post](/tree-posts/classical-and-matrix-approach).\n## **Determinate or Indeterminate Structures**\n[Determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures) is a crucial concept, especially in the classical approach. It helps us know what methods and techniques we need to use to solve the structure.\n## **Plane or Space Structures**\nEven though they're 3D objects, engineers can analyze structures in [either 2D or 3D space](/tree-posts/plane-and-spatial-structures). It would depend on the layout of the supports and members.\nIt's good to classify whether a structure can be a plane or space because it will help engineers know the scale of their analysis. Two-dimensional buildings are more straightforward to solve. For example, the equilibrium equations to solve a 2D structure would be **three**. For a 3D building, that would be **six**.\n## **Static or Dynamic Loads**\nThe [load type](/tree-posts/static-and-dynamic-analysis) would also influence what analysis type to make. For example, when dealing with moving objects, the structure behaves differently depending on the load's location. A different study is needed compared to one with a static load.\nOther dynamic loads, such as wind and earthquakes, would need a unique analysis.\n## **Linear or Nonlinear Structures**\nStructures can deform [linearly or non-linearly](/tree-posts/linear-and-nonlinear-analysis) - the former deals with objects that return to their original place when the load is released, while the latter does not return.\nEngineers allow their structures to go in the latter in certain situations. The analysis for such is different compared to a linear building.\n## Summary\n> Classifications of analysis include: (1) classical, matrix, or FEM approach, (2) determinate or indeterminate structures, (3) plane or space structures, (4) static or dynamic loads, and (5) linear or non-linear structures.\n",

      "Free Content": "The beam is a [long slender member](/tree-posts/what-is-a-structural-member) designed to resist loads. It can be a simple wooden plank to cross an obstacle, a gymnast's tool to practice one's balance, or a girder to support the floor.\nIt is one of the [basic structures](/tree-posts/investigating-the-fundamental-structures) an engineer can use. For example, structural engineers can use a series of purlins to support the roof; a mechanical engineer can use a beam to design types of machinery and equipment. The real-life applications are endless.\n## What Makes a Beam?\n![Beams are long slender objects that can have different longitudinal and transverse properties](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453b706aaa5290e6b814c6c_WTS-Structure_3.15-1.png)\nBeams can be of various shapes and sizes. For example,\n-   **Geometry.** The length of the beam can be [straight or curved](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-longitudinally).\n-   **Material.** The beam's [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material) can be wood, metal, concrete, or other. It can also be a combination of two or more materials.\n-   **Shape.** The [cross-section shape](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the beam can be a rectangle, circle, or any custom shape. It can be symmetrical or asymmetrical.\n-   **Uniformity.** The cross-section along the beam can be [uniform or non-uniform](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-longitudinally) (An example of non-uniform would be tapered, stepped, or haunched beams)\n-   **Configuration.** It can be a [single beam or a combination of multiple beams](/tree-posts/how-do-we-classify-beams).\nThese factors depend on the beam's purpose. If you're dealing with structural girders to resist building loads, we can use a straight steel flange section or a straight reinforced concrete rectangular beam section.\n## How Do Beams Behave?\n![Beams predominantly experience shear and flexural stresses](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6453b7145ee09b98a227d6b8_WTS-Structure_3.15-2.png)\nWhen loads act on a beam, the primary behavior is that it bends along its length. As a result, the beam will predominantly experience shear and flexural stresses. Later on, we'll see more about how this works as we go along with the course.\n## Summary\n> The beam is a long slender member designed to resist loads.\n> A beam can vary in terms of five aspects: (1) configuration, (2) geometry, (3) material, (4) shape, and (5) uniformity\n> The beam will mainly experience shear and flexural stresses.\n",

The author converted the answer from the SI solution to English to reflect the latter system.

All members are assumed to have a [uniform section](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-members-at-cross-section) of the same [material](/tree-posts/what-is-structural-material). \n![Simple Warren truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cc18545aff0f28eb573a_WTS-Structure_21.02-1.png)\n## Structural Loads\nThe truss has the following [static loads](/tree-posts/how-do-we-describe-loads):\n-   A \\\\(20kN (4.5kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\n-   A \\\\(40kN (9.0kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\n-   A \\\\(10kN (2.25kip)\\\\) concentrated load.\nWe can see the position and direction of these loads in the following figure. We can talk more about this in preparation.\n## Structural Analysis\n_Type of Analysis: Classical Approach, Linear Analysis, Static Loads, Plane Truss, Determinate Truss_\n### Preparation\n_Before analyzing a structure, we'll need to make some preparations first. That includes setting up our references and finding their determinacy._\n#### Set-Up References\n![Setting-up the references of the Warren truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cc2811af0d9f92a83d6c_WTS-Structure_21.02-2.png)\n_An excellent structural analysis must have a_ _[uniform mathematical understanding](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-references)_ _of the structure. It ensures that other people can easily understand your results._\nWe first place a Cartesian grid with its origin defined by our preference. In this case, let's assign the origin \\\\(A(0, 0)\\\\) at the bottom-left joint of the truss. Consequently, the x-axis will run along the length of the truss with the y-axis perpendicular to it at the origin.\nWe also need to identify the location of all points of interest: the location of [supports](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-supports), [joints](/tree-posts/what-are-structural-joints-and-connections), and [loads](/tree-posts/structural-loads):\n-   \\\\(A(0.0m, 0.0m)\\\\) \\\\(A(0.0ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). Hinge support and truss joint.\n-   \\\\(B(1.5m, 2.6m)\\\\) \\\\(B(4.9ft, 8.5ft)\\\\). Truss joint and location of \\\\(20kN (4.5kips)\\\\) horizontal load to the right.\n-   \\\\(C(3.0m, 0.0m)\\\\) \\\\(C(9.8ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). Truss joint and location of \\\\(40kN (9kips)\\\\) vertical downward load.\n-   \\\\(D(4.5m, 2.6m)\\\\) \\\\(D(14.8ft, 8.5ft)\\\\).

Truss joint.\n-   \\\\(G(9.0m, 0.0m)\\\\) \\\\(G(29.5ft, 0.0ft)\\\\). Truss joint and location of \\\\(10kN (2.25kips)\\\\) vertical downward load.\nYou can label each joint according to your preference. The most important thing is that its coordinates must be defined appropriately.\n#### Determinacy\n_We need to find the structure's_ _[determinacy](/tree-posts/statically-determinate-and-indeterminate-structures)_ _\\\\(D\\\\) to know our approach._\nFor a 2D truss, it is:\n\\\\(D=(m+r)-2j\\\\)\nFor this truss example, there are 11 members: \\\\(AB\\\\), \\\\(BC\\\\), \\\\(CD\\\\), \\\\(DE\\\\), \\\\(EF\\\\), \\\\(FG\\\\), \\\\(AG\\\\), \\\\(CE\\\\), \\\\(EG\\\\), \\\\(BD\\\\), \\\\(DF\\\\), 7 joints: \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\), \\\\(F\\\\), \\\\(G\\\\), and 3 reaction components: \\\\(A\\_h\\\\), \\\\(A\\_v\\\\), \\\\(R\\_E\\\\); hence \\\\(D=0\\\\)\n\\\\(D=(11+3)-2(7)=0\\\\)\n_A determinacy of zero indicates that the structure can be analyzed using only the_ _[equilibrium](/tree-posts/what-is-equilibrium)_ _equations._\n### Main Analysis\n#### Stability\n_The first requirement is to know if our structure is_ _[externally and internally stable](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-truss-stability)._\nLet's examine its external stability first: \n1.  The reaction components \\\\(A\\_h, A\\_v, R\\_E\\\\) are not collinear, parallel, or concurrent with each other.\n2.  The determinacy is equal to zero.\nFrom these observations, we can conclude the truss is externally stable. \nIn terms of its internal stability, the truss arrangement doesn't pose any risks of excessive deformation or immediate collapse; hence, it's internally stable.\n_Since the structure is externally and internally stable, we can proceed with the analysis. If it is unstable, we may have to adjust its model before proceeding._\n#### Reactions\n![Solving for the reactions of the Warren truss example](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cc358e9cf550ca6d6189_WTS-Structure_21.02-3.png)\n_The second requirement for a complete analysis is to compute the support loads of the structure. Solving for the components enables us to understand the transfer of loads._\nFor a determinate structure, solving for its reactions is straightforward. To solve it, always remember that the whole model must obey the laws of equilibrium.\nAs a demonstration, we first break the support loads into their components (not their resultant) along the axes. In our example, we have three components:\n-   We assume \\\\(A\\_h\\\\) to be acting towards the left, and \n-   \\\\(A\\_v\\\\) and \\\\(R\\_E\\\\) are acting upwards.\nThen, applying the equilibrium equations:\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_h}=0]\\space{\\rightarrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(20-A\\_h=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_h=20kN (4.5kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{M\\_A}=0]\\space{\\circlearrowright\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(40(3)-R\\_E(3+3)+10(3+3+3)+20(2.6)=0\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_E=43.67kN(9.82kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(\\sum{F\\_v}=0]\\space{\\uparrow\\_+}\\\\)\n\\\\(43.67-40-10+A\\_v=0\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=6.33kN(1.42kip)\\\\)\nFrom our calculations, the reaction components of the structure are: \n\\\\(A\\_h=20kN (4.5kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(A\\_v=6.33kN(1.42kip)\\\\)\n\\\\(R\\_E=43.67kN(9.82kip)\\\\)\nIf our answer is negative, the assumed direction is wrong, and the correct one is the opposite.\n#### Force Analysis\n_The third requirement for a complete analysis is understanding the internal force and stress developed on the structure due to the applied loads._\nWe have four types of stresses to analyze: axial, shear, moment, and torsion. Typically, we do these by modeling the behavior using functions and diagrams.\nIn our example, the predominant forces the members will experience are [axial](/tree-posts/what-is-a-truss).\n##### Modeling Axial Behavior\nOur task now is to determine the force developed for each member.\nWe use two primary methods to solve the member forces:\n-   The [method of joints](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-joints) and,\n-   The [method of sections](/tree-posts/what-is-the-method-of-sections). \nSimple trusses, like our example, can be solved using either of the two. Below are links showing the solution to these bar forces:\n-   [Full solution](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-joints) using method of joints\n-   [Full solution](/tree-posts/how-to-use-the-method-of-sections) using method of sections\nThe following section shows the summarized results for each truss member.\n###### Axial\n![Summary of all axial forces](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/6432cc4e2bb6b493659f3ba8_WTS-Structure_21.02-4.png)\n**Table**\nUsually, we summarize the results in a tabular format:\nFor easy reference, it is best to [categorize](/tree-posts/what-are-the-parts-of-a-truss) each member - top chord, bottom chords, and web members.\n‍\n**Diagram**\nSometimes, we may have a visual aid of the bar forces acting per member using axial diagrams:\n‍\nThese diagrams are helpful if we deal with members with varying cross sections or material along its length, for example.\n#### Deflections\n_The final requirement is to analyze the structure's_ _[deflection](/tree-posts/how-to-analyze-deflection). In this part, we analyze the translations and rotations of the object from their original position._\nWe have two types to analyze: rotation and translation. As in the previous part, we can describe their behavior using functions and diagrams.\nThe topic of deflection deserves a separate section. There are many ways how to explain a structure's movement, such as:\n-   [Virtual Work Method](/tree-posts/deriving-virtual-work-due-to-axial-strains)\n",

It will consist of three members and three joints. From this triangle truss, you can add one point in space and connect two members to it to expand the truss. Any truss made this way is a simple truss.\nFrom roof trusses to truss bridges, simple trusses are usually the most common type of truss you'll see.

One characteristic is that you can't use conventional analysis methods (which we will learn later) to solve it.\nLike the compound truss, complex trusses are mostly solutions for a specific instance. For instance, we can use it as a complicated framework for equipment or machinery.\n## Summary\n> There are three types of trusses depending on their configuration: (1) simple, (2) compound, and (3) complex.\n> A simple truss is the most basic form. A truss constructed from a triangular truss and expanded to create a network of members and joints is a simple truss.\n> A compound truss is a truss made up of two or more simple trusses connected using connection elements.\n> A complex truss is a truss that can neither be simple nor compound.\n",

To put it simply:\n## It's A Way To Model Phenomena\n![Functions are a way to model phenomena](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e351cb4f8b9ac4f88e0d44_WTS-1-Mathematics_Importance-1.png)\nFunctions (and relations) can represent most of the world's events. To demonstrate, the following are examples of relationships:\n-   The money put inside a vending machine and the drink that will come out of it\n-   The time spent studying and the resulting grades\n-   The distance traveled by a vehicle to its speed\n-   The radius of a circle to its area\n-   The amount of workforce and work accomplished\n-   The number of hours spent in the office and one's salary\n-   The number of customers and the sales generated\n-   The amount of water evaporated and the intensity of the rain\n-   The amount of sunlight and crop production\nThe examples above are just a handful of many phenomena we can represent using functions. Once we create these expressions, it can help us analyze, investigate, and predict behavior among these sets. It provides us with a model or a structure that leads us to the next point:\n## A Tool For Creating Solutions\n![Functions are tools for creating solutions](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6352a802ef305ab6dadec785/64e351d46084d30ada9fc79c_WTS-1-Mathematics_Importance-2.png)\nFunctions serve as a tool to help us develop solutions, improve products and services, or make logical choices. There are many things we can do with it once we create one. For example:\n-   When we know the link between hours in the office and work generated, we can find the optimum number of hours to ensure maximum output.\n-   We can find the right amount of water if we know the link between crop production and watering.\n-   We can predict sales if we have a relation between sales and the number of customers.\n-   We will know the optimum number of workers needed to finish a task if we see the connection between the worker and their job.\n## Some Examples\nLet's consider more specific examples of the use of functions:\n-   In the study of projectile motion, we use two functions to describe the position of the projectile along its trajectory: \\\\(d\\_x{t}=V\\_x{t}\\\\) for horizontal and \\\\(d\\_y{t}=d\\_o+V\\_y{t}+g{t^2}\\\\) for vertical distance. We use the variable time \\\\(t\\\\) - domain to get the object's position in both directions. Knowing these functions allows us to accurately predict where it will land and make adjustments when designing cannons and other equipment.\n-   We can model bacteria growth as an exponential function \\\\(e\\\\). As time \\\\(t\\\\) (domain) goes by, the number of bacteria \\\\(N\\_B\\\\) (range) grows exponentially: \\\\(N\\_B=Ce^{rt}\\\\) (the symbols \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(r\\\\) are constants). Analyzing how bacteria grows over time helps us how to culture or engineer it.\n-   Engineers aim to study the behavior of internal forces on objects when subjected to loads. To achieve this, they express [internal forces](/tree-posts/what-is-internal-force) such as axial \\\\(N\\\\), shear \\\\(V\\\\), moment \\\\(M\\\\), and torsion \\\\(T\\\\) in relation to the object's position (x). Engineers specify the domain, which is the position (x) they want to investigate, and the function yields the range, which includes \\\\(N\\\\), \\\\(V\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), and \\\\(T\\\\). Finding these will help engineers design the appropriate size and shape of the object.\n## Summary\n> Functions are a way to represent phenomena.\n> Functions are tools that help us create solutions.\n",
